<h2>OR, TEN DAYS A NEWSBOY.</h2>



<h2 style="padding-top: 3em;"><span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span></h2>

<h3>PAUL&rsquo;S INTRODUCTION TO NEW YORK.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcaph"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>e was a stray boy, with a very strange story. The
two ragged boys, one of whom had a bundle of
papers under his arm, and the other the outfit of a
boot-black slung over his shoulder, thought that at
the best he was stretching the truth to an alarming degree,
even though his manner appeared to bear out what he said.</p>

<p>He had met these two boys at the corner of Cortlandt
and West streets, in New York City, and had stated his
case to them, believing that they could tell him what to do.
This was the story he told:</p>

<p>The family, consisting of his father, mother, sister, and
himself, had come from Chicago for the purpose of sailing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
in a steamer&mdash;which one he was unable to say&mdash;for Europe.
They went directly from the cars to the pier, and had gone
on board the huge vessel which was to be their home while
crossing the Atlantic. After they had been there some
time, and he could see no evidences that the steamer was
about to start, he had asked his mother&rsquo;s permission to go
on deck for the purpose of making the acquaintance of a
boy about his own age, whom he had seen when they first
came on board. The attempt at making the acquaintance
was so successful that in five minutes they were firm
friends, and in as many more had laid all kinds of plans
for future enjoyment.</p>

<p>Both the boys claimed to excel in the art of kinging the
ring; but, unfortunately, neither one had a top with him.
Then this one who was telling the story proposed that he
should go on shore and buy two, while the other remained
to inform the absent boy&rsquo;s parents where he had gone.</p>

<p>He had had some difficulty in finding a top to suit him,
and he thought that he must have spent at least an hour in
the search. When at last he had procured two good ones&mdash;and
he showed them in proof of the truthfulness of his story&mdash;he
was nearly as long again in finding his way back to the
steamer. Not knowing the name of the vessel, nor the line
to which she belonged, he was obliged to visit each pier in
succession, in order to find the right one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>
<img src="images/lbtdn03.jpg" width="600" height="558" alt="" />
<span class="caption">HE SHOWED THEM IN PROOF OF THE TRUTHFULNESS OF HIS STORY.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
When, from the appearance of the buildings opposite, he
knew that he was back again to the point from which he
had started, he learned to his dismay that the steamer had
been gone fully an hour. At first he could hardly realize
that he had been left behind, while his parents had started
on such a long voyage, and he could not account for the neglect
of his newly-made friend in not telling them that he
had gone on shore, unless it was owing to the fact that he
had neglected to point out his father, or to tell what his
name was.</p>

<p>After he had fully realized that he was alone in a great
city, with no means of providing himself with food and
shelter, save through the medium of two very nice tops and
six cents, he started in search of the depot which they had
arrived at, intending to take the next train back to Chicago,
providing the conductor would take his tops in payment.
But he could not find the depot, and at nearly seven
o&rsquo;clock in the evening he had stopped to ask advice from
two boys of about his own age&mdash;neither one of them was
over eleven years old&mdash;in the hope that they could straighten
matters out for him.</p>

<p>These two were very much inclined to doubt his story
until he showed the tops as proof, and even then they would
have looked upon some portions of it as false had he not
also produced the six cents, and with three of them stood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
treat all round to that sticky delicacy known as &ldquo;pea-nut
taffy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they believed all he had told them, and adjourning
to a very broad door-step near by, they sat down to consult
upon what it was best for him to do. To begin with, and
in order that he might understand the case fully, one of the
boys asked, as he struggled with the sticky dainty,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul Weston,&rdquo; replied the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my name&rsquo;s Johnny Jones, though the boys call
me Shiner,&rdquo; said the boy with the papers under his arm,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; my chum here&rsquo;s named Ben Treat. Now you know
us; an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll call you Polly, so&rsquo;s to make you feel more&rsquo;s if
you was home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul was not just certain as to how far this nickname
would go towards making him feel at home, but he did not
venture to make any remark upon it, preferring rather that
his own condition, and how he could better it, should be the
subject under discussion.</p>

<p>Johnny Jones told him at once that his idea of trying to
get home by the cars without money enough in his pocket
to buy his ticket was an impossibility; for he and Ben had
tried riding on the cars without paying for it, even a short
distance, and had always come to grief because of either the
conductor or the brakemen, whom they looked upon as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
natural enemies of boys. It was useless, therefore, to think
of getting to Chicago in that way, and Johnny appealed to
Ben to decide whether he was right or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s jest as Shiner says,&rdquo; replied Ben, rubbing the end of
his nose thoughtfully, as if he believed that gave him more
of an air of wisdom. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t git as far as Newark
in a week, &rsquo;less you walked, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d better not try it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what shall I do?&rdquo; asked Paul, in such distress that
even the candy failed to soothe him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see but one way,&rdquo; said Johnny, gravely, as he
took the lump of sweetness from his mouth, lest it should
dissolve while he was not able to give it his undivided attention,
and he thus lose a portion of the treat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
to stay here till yer earn money enough ter pay for a whole
ticket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how much will that be?&rdquo; asked Paul, astounded at
the careless way with which the boy spoke of such an
undertaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno; but it&rsquo;ll be a good deal. We&rsquo;ll find out termorrer.&rdquo;
Then Johnny turned his attention to the candy
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t earn any money;&rdquo; and now Paul was on the
verge of crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course yer can,&rdquo; replied Ben, decidedly. &ldquo;Yer can
sell papers like Shiner does, or yer can get a box, an&rsquo; go
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
inter the same bizness I&rsquo;m in. Ef yer smart, yer&rsquo;ll git three
or four dollars a week, &rsquo;cordin&rsquo; to the weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul opened his eyes wide with surprise as this enormous
amount was spoken of, and he almost forgot his grief
in the visions of wealth that floated through his brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shiner an&rsquo; I hain&rsquo;t got much money in our pockets,&rdquo;
continued Ben, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause we&rsquo;re buyin&rsquo; some real estate, an&rsquo; we
put it all in that &rsquo;bout as fast as we git it; but we can patch
up an&rsquo; lend you enough to start with, an&rsquo; you can pay it
back when you git the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surely Paul thought he was fortunate in having made
the acquaintance of two boys who were so well off in this
world&rsquo;s goods as Ben and Johnny, and his position did not
seem nearly as bad as it had half an hour ago, even though
it was nearly dark, and he had no idea where he should
sleep that night.</p>

<p>He did not know, any more than his newly-made friends
did, that by telling his story to the police he would be taken
care of until his relatives in Chicago could be written to,
and he believed that he must depend upon his own exertions
to get home. Therefore he eagerly accepted the generous
offer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where can I live?&rdquo; he asked, as the thought came
to him that even though a chance for making himself rich
had suddenly presented itself, he was still without a home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Ben tell yer that we&rsquo;d been &rsquo;vestin&rsquo; our money
in real estate?&rdquo; asked Johnny, almost impatiently, and speaking
rather indistinctly because of his mouth being so filled
with candy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a place we bought of Dickey Spry,
an&rsquo; you can stay with us if you pay your share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul was willing to go into any extravagances for the
sake of having a home, provided his two tops, and the
three cents still remaining of his wealth, was sufficient to
make the first payment. This he told his friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shiner didn&rsquo;t mean that you was to pay it right down,&rdquo;
said Ben, quickly. &ldquo;After you git to makin&rsquo; money for
yourself, all you&rsquo;ve got to do is to buy your share of the
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As that was only just, Paul agreed to it, and Johnny, who
had by this time succeeded in eating the dark-colored mixture
that was by courtesy called candy, started off to dispose
of the papers he still held under his arm, while Ben
led Paul away with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny has got to &rsquo;tend right up to biz,&rdquo; said Ben, in a
half-explanatory way, &ldquo;or else he&rsquo;d git stuck, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would he?&rdquo; asked Paul, in evident alarm. &ldquo;Who would
stick him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben looked at this young gentleman from Chicago in surprise,
and then in pity. He could not understand how any
one, and more especially a boy, could be so ignorant of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
meaning of one of the most common words of slang. At
first he looked as if he was about to reprove such ignorance;
but he evidently thought better of it, for he said,
instead,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that he&rsquo;d be stuck by havin&rsquo; a lot of this afternoon&rsquo;s
papers left over on his hands, an&rsquo; he couldn&rsquo;t sell &rsquo;em
termorrer, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul really looked relieved to know that no worse danger
threatened Johnny; and as he walked along with Ben, the
latter said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yer see, Shiner would have been about through work if
we hadn&rsquo;t met you, an&rsquo; fooled away so much of our time.
Now it&rsquo;ll take him quite a while to sell out, an&rsquo; so you an&rsquo; I
might as well go down to ther house. I&rsquo;ve had a pretty
fair day&rsquo;s work, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll git up such a supper as&rsquo;ll make
Shiner&rsquo;s eyes stick out more&rsquo;n a foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then they were opposite a grocery store, and he went
in to begin the work of making his companion&rsquo;s eyes stick
out. It was with the air of one who felt able to purchase
at least half the store contained, in case he should want to,
that he ordered half a pound of bologna sausage, a pound
of crackers, and two candles. He was also very careful to
see that he was given full weight.</p>

<p>Paul was a little mystified as to what share the candles
could have in extending Johnny&rsquo;s eyes; but he thought it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
better to wait the course of events, rather than to ask any
questions.</p>

<p>When Ben had been served, and there had been quite a
delay in paying for the articles, owing to his inability to
count his money three times, and have it amount to the
same sum each time, he came out and completed his purchases
by buying a quart of pea-nuts at a stand near by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Ben said, with evident satisfaction, as he gave
Paul one of the bundles to carry, &ldquo;I guess when Shiner
gets home, an&rsquo; finds all these things, he&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re havin&rsquo;
a reg&rsquo;lar party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul agreed very mildly to this assertion, for he had not
been accustomed to look upon such an assortment as much
of a treat, and already he began to have vague misgivings as
to the value of the real estate Ben had spoken of so proudly.</p>

<p>To Paul, tired as he was from the walking he had already
done, and the excitement through which he had passed, it
seemed as if they would never reach this place which Ben
called home, for his guide turned up one street and down
another until he was quite worn out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place, jest ahead there,&rdquo; said Ben, in a cautious
whisper, as he halted at the corner of a street, and
pointed to a small yard in the rear of what seemed to be a
warehouse. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place, but we&rsquo;ve got to look out
that nobody don&rsquo;t see us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
Paul believed that his companion referred to the building,
and he was surprised to find it so large; yet why they had
come around to the rear was more than he could understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you keep right behind me, an&rsquo; you come quick,&rdquo;
said Ben, as he looked carefully around to assure himself
that there was no one in sight.</p>

<p>Paul followed the directions, wondering why one was
obliged to use such precautions in getting into his own
house, and Ben led the way, not into the building, but
over the fence and down into the yard, where was stored
empty boxes and barrels of every description.</p>

<p>As if he was perfectly familiar with the way, Ben went
among the boxes to the farther end of the yard, where there
was a hogshead and a large packing-case close together. He
pulled the case a few inches aside&mdash;for it had been placed
directly in front of the hogshead&mdash;and whispered,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get in, quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul obeyed, hardly believing that this could be the real
estate his companions had spoken of, and Ben followed him,
pulling the box against the hogshead again so adroitly as to
betoken considerable practice.</p>

<p>When one of the candles was lighted, and stuck into an
empty ink-bottle that served as candlestick, Paul was able
to see the interior, and he stared at it in surprise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
The case was evidently used as a place in which to keep
their food, and as a sort of general storehouse, for an old
coat was lying neatly folded up in one corner, and opposite
it were several tin cans, all showing more or less marks of
age, and in a battered condition.</p>

<p>The hogshead had been lined with old newspapers, and
from the fact that quite a quantity of straw covered the
bottom, it was easy to see that this was the sleeping-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Ben, triumphantly, &ldquo;you can stay here an&rsquo;
live off the fat of the land jest as long as you want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Paul never realized that, if he had tried, he could
not have hidden himself more completely from those who
might be searching for him, than by thus sharing the fortunes
of these two Arabs of the street.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h2>

<h3>STARTING IN BUSINESS.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>here was a look of delight on Ben&rsquo;s face as he
saw his companion examining their home so carefully,
and each moment he expected to hear his
exclamation of surprise at the very comfortable
manner in which they lived. But since, after waiting some
time, no such exclamation was heard, he asked, a trifle impatiently,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it a stunner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Paul did not really think the place merited any
such praise. In fact, he was considerably disappointed, and
he compromised the matter by saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think it might be real kind o&rsquo; comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kind o&rsquo; comfortable!&rdquo; echoed Ben, angrily. &ldquo;Well, I
don&rsquo;t know anything about Chicago, but if you know of
any fellers there that have got any better place than this,
I&rsquo;d like to go out an&rsquo; stay two or three months with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see I don&rsquo;t know much about it,&rdquo; said Paul,
conscious that he had hurt his kind-hearted friend&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
feelings, and anxious to make amends in some way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
lived in a regular house with father and mother, so I
don&rsquo;t know how boys do live that haven&rsquo;t got any home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see how they live before you get back to Chicago,&rdquo;
said Ben, grimly; and then he added, in a softened
voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see how it would seem to have a father
an&rsquo; a mother, an&rsquo; a house to live in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever have any, Ben?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and the boy&rsquo;s voice trembled now in spite of himself;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose I ever did. Me an&rsquo; Shiner have been
livin&rsquo; round this way ever since we can remember, an&rsquo; I
reckon we always lived so. We used to sleep &rsquo;round anywhere
till Dickey Spry got a chance to run a stand over&rsquo;n
Jersey City, an&rsquo; then he sold us this place for fifty cents,
an&rsquo; I tell you we&rsquo;ve fatted right up ever since we had it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation was taking such a sorrowful turn that
Johnny&rsquo;s entrance just then was very welcome. Paul stood
very much in need of some cheerful company, to prevent the
great lump that was growing in his throat from getting the
best of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are goin&rsquo; it strong!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny, as he
closed the door, by pulling one portion of their house against
the other. &ldquo;Why this is &rsquo;bout as good as a &rsquo;lectric light,
ain&rsquo;t it? I tell you we shall be jest as snug as mice when
winter comes, for this candle makes the place so warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
Johnny&rsquo;s idea of the heat from one candle could not be a
correct one, if he thought that their house would be as warm
in January from it as it was then in August. But January
was so far away that no one thought of starting an argument
on the subject.</p>

<p>Ben brought forward the dainties he had bought, and although
Shiner&rsquo;s eyes did not stick out as far as he had said,
there was enough of a pleasant surprise in his face to satisfy
Ben for the outlay he had made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now this is what I call livin&rsquo; high,&rdquo; said Johnny, in a
choking voice, as he tried to eat pea-nuts, bologna sausage,
and crackers, all at the same time. &ldquo;Seems like we&rsquo;d had
a reg&rsquo;lar streak of luck ever since we bought this house,
don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a good trade, that&rsquo;s what it was, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s lucky for
Polly that we had it, or he&rsquo;d found out the difference in
huntin&rsquo; round for a place to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Paul! he was doing his best to eat the portion of the
feast that had been set aside as his, but, hungry as he had
been, he found it difficult to swallow because of the lump in
his throat, that kept growing larger and larger every moment,
and which seemed to be doing its best to force the
tears from his eyes.</p>

<p>He thought of his parents and his sister, who were probably
going farther away from him each moment, grieving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
quite as much, if not more, because of his absence than he
did himself; and when he realized that he might never see
them again, the tears would roll from beneath his eyelids.
But he brushed them away very quickly, as if ashamed to
have his companions see them, honest though they were.</p>

<p>Then, as Ben and Johnny began to talk of their business,
leaving him alone, as it seemed, the tears came faster and
faster, until he could no longer wipe them away, and putting
back into the paper the cracker he was trying to eat, he threw
himself upon the straw, crying as if his heart would break.</p>

<p>Paul&rsquo;s hosts seemed bewildered by such singular behavior
on his part. They could not understand why a boy who
had had the good-fortune to find such a place in which to
sleep as they had just offered Paul should cry, and not understanding
it, they did the very best thing for him&mdash;they
let him cry, without trying to console him, though it sadly
marred the happiness of their feast.</p>

<p>The tears were a relief to Paul in more ways than one, for
before they were done flowing he was sound asleep, and he
did not awake to a consciousness of his troubles until Ben
shook him the following morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to get up,&rdquo; said the boy, in a kindly tone. &ldquo;You
see, Shiner has to get down about sunrise to buy his papers,
an&rsquo; I go with him, so&rsquo;s folks won&rsquo;t be so likely to see us
comin&rsquo; out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
It was some moments before Paul realized where he was,
or what had happened to so change his sleeping-room from
the neat, cleanly one he called his own at home, to this very
rude shelter. But when all that had occurred came back to
his mind, he leaped to his feet at once, striking his head
against the top of the hogshead with a force that told him he
must be careful to get up no higher than his hands and knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see now what a swell house we&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; said
Johnny, when they were outside, and while Paul was still
rubbing the top of his head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got runnin&rsquo; water near
every room, jest like any place, an&rsquo; you can come in here an&rsquo;
wash yer face with jest as much water as Astor can git.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Johnny led the way to one corner of the building, where
a water-pipe with a faucet jutted out from the brick-work,
having evidently been placed there in case of fire, and turning
the water on, the three boys scrubbed their faces and
hands with the greatest vigor. But Paul found some difficulty
in drying himself with straw as his companions did.</p>

<p>During this important ceremony the boys had been careful
to screen themselves from the view of any one on the
street by the boxes, which they had arranged beforehand.
When they were as clean as the water would make them
without soap, they started out of the yard at full speed, going
over the fence as a rubber ball goes over any projection
in its way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
Once on the street, where they were not afraid of any
one seeing them, their movements were more leisurely,
and they began to discuss plans for starting their guest in
business.</p>

<p>But the discussion was not a long one, owing to the fact
that but two avenues of trade were open to him&mdash;that of
blackening boots or selling papers; and when he was called
upon to decide, he chose the latter, very much to Johnny&rsquo;s
secret delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Ben,&rdquo; said Johnny, who appeared to think it his
duty to look out for his guest&rsquo;s business education and welfare,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d better kinder lay &rsquo;round an&rsquo; see that the boys
don&rsquo;t try to come it on him the first day, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll keep my
eye on him too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben nodded assent, and Johnny said to Paul,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You watch, an&rsquo; see how I do it, after I git the papers,
an&rsquo; then you do jest as I do. If there is a big lot of news,
it won&rsquo;t be a great deal of work; but if there ain&rsquo;t anything
very &rsquo;portant, then you&rsquo;ve got to holler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this lesson had been given, and while they were
walking towards the newspaper offices, Ben divided what
bologna had been left from the feast of the previous evening,
and also put in Paul&rsquo;s pocket his share of the pea-nuts
which he had not eaten with the others.</p>

<p>On account of finding an early customer who wanted his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
boots blackened, Ben did not go with them to get the papers,
but promised to meet Paul on City Hall Square, where it
had been decided he should make his first venture as newsboy.</p>

<p>Now the boys who sell the papers do not buy their stock
in the business offices, as Paul had supposed, but are obliged
to go into some room nearer the presses, and where they
will be out of the way of more important customers.
Therefore, when Johnny led him into a room lighted by
gas, even though it was in the day-time, and filled by a crowd
of noisy, pushing, eager boys, all wanting to be served first,
Paul felt quite as much alarmed as surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Johnny, as he saw his companion
was about to draw back; &ldquo;there won&rsquo;t anybody try to
hurt you here, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll git used to it after you&rsquo;ve come
two or three times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul hardly believed that he should become accustomed
to anything of the kind; but before they had finished their
rounds&mdash;for Johnny carried four of the different morning
papers&mdash;he could look upon the scene, which was almost
the same in each case, with something very nearly approaching
interest.</p>

<p>When at last the stock was procured, Johnny divided it,
giving half to Paul, and saying, as he did so,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll git all the papers for a while, till you kinder git
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
used to it, an&rsquo; then you can git &rsquo;em for yerself. Now come
over here on the Square an&rsquo; sing out, as loud as you know
how, jest what I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, for example, Johnny began shouting his wares in a
way that was more noisy than distinct. But after he had
repeated it several times, selling two papers in the meanwhile,
Paul had no more idea of what he said than if he had
been speaking in a foreign tongue.</p>

<p>Johnny would have lost a good deal of the morning trade,
which was quite brisk, in his efforts to start Paul aright, if
Ben had not come along, and offered to give the beginner
his first lesson.</p>

<p>Paul found it rather difficult to make as much noise as
Ben seemed to think necessary, for the sound of his own
voice frightened him; but in the course of an hour, during
which time his instructor alternately blackened boots and
gave him lessons, he had got along so well that he was selling
quite a number of papers. His success did a great deal
towards helping him fight off the homesick feeling that
would come over him.</p>

<p>At first none of the other newsboys paid any attention to
him, perhaps because they were too busy; but as trade began
to grow dull they commenced to gather around Paul,
until he was thoroughly alarmed at some of the demonstrations
they made.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
One boy, considerably larger than he was, insisted that if
he wanted to sell papers he should go somewhere else to
do it, because that particular portion of the city was under
the immediate control of himself and his friends. Paul
made no reply, for the very good reason that he did not
know but that the claim which this boy set up was a just
one, and he remained silent, which caused his tormentors
to think&mdash;exactly what was the true state of the case&mdash;that
he was afraid of them.</p>

<p>One boy, the same who had first spoken, began pushing
him aside, and poor Paul, seeing at least a dozen boys, nearly
all of them larger than he was, standing in threatening attitudes,
looked around in vain for his two friends, who had
promised to care for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to get out of this, young feller, an&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t
want to show your nose &rsquo;round here agin,&rdquo; said the largest
member of the party, as he pushed Paul rudely aside with
one hand, and with the other attempted to take his papers
from him.</p>

<p>It was this, more than anything else, which made Paul
resist; for even if he had no right on that particular spot,
they surely had no right to take his papers from him; and
besides, they were Johnny&rsquo;s property, not his. Therefore
he felt he should defend them all the more strongly.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;IF YOU PICK ANY ROW WITH HIM, YOU PICK IT WITH ME AND JOHNNY.&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>He was trying to call up all his strength and will in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
defence of his own rights, even though he knew the struggle
could not be a long one, owing to the numbers that were opposed
to him, when suddenly the crowd were pressed apart
at one side, and Ben and Johnny stood ready to defend their
guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This feller lives with us,&rdquo; said Ben, defiantly, as he
looked fiercely at the boy who had been trying to rob Paul,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to sell papers here every day. Now don&rsquo;t
any of you forget that if you pick any row with him, you
pick it with me an&rsquo; Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More than one of those present knew just what Ben could
do if he should swing that box around in defence of any
one who was being imposed upon, and they concluded that
it was not best to discuss the matter any further. The
crowd fell back, and Paul was safe, for a short time, at
least.</p>

<p>Johnny had sold all his own stock out, and taking half
of Paul&rsquo;s, the two commenced business again. They had no
further trouble from those who had been so eager to drive
the new boy away, and by dinner-time all the papers
were sold. But Paul was ignorant that in every one was an
advertisement setting forth an exact description of himself,
together with the promise of a large reward to the person
who would take him to his father at police head-quarters.</p>

<h3>MAKING ACQUAINTANCES.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>he first day&rsquo;s work at selling newspapers was particularly
hard for Paul Weston, and more than once
was it necessary for both Ben and Johnny to interfere,
to save him from what might have been serious
trouble with that class of newsboys who made it their
especial business to drive any new-comer away.</p>

<p>And it would not have been a very long or difficult task
to have made Paul retire from the business if he had not
had these two friends, so experienced in the ways and hard
corners of street life.</p>

<p>According to the best judgment of both Ben and Johnny,
the only course which Paul could pursue, with any hope of
ever reaching his friends in Chicago, was to earn sufficient
money by the sale of papers to pay his fare on there. It is
true that while Paul had given himself up to grief on the
previous evening, and they had left their hogshead home in
order that he might be alone, a wild idea of writing to some
of his relatives had crossed their minds; but it had not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
assumed such shape that they felt warranted in speaking of it
to him.</p>

<p>The surest way, they reasoned, to restore him to his home
was for him to earn sufficient money to take him there
properly, and to that end they labored during the first day
of his apprenticeship.</p>

<p>They neglected their own work to make it known among
their acquaintances that he was under their immediate care,
and that they should resent to the utmost of their power
any effort to drive him from his task. They also kept a
strict watch over him, and whenever they saw signs of discouragement
upon his face, which they did many times,
they encouraged him by kind words and advice to continue
in his labors, holding before him the hope of meeting his
parents once more as the reward of his exertions.</p>

<p>Never once did the thought come to them that by keeping
him within their world they were most effectually hiding
him from his parents; and since they were doing their
best to aid him, even if it was the worst thing they could
do, they were none the less friends to him in the truest
sense of the word.</p>

<p>That noon, in order to cheer the sorrowful boy as much
as possible, they resolved on having such a feast as they allowed
themselves only on extra occasions, and that was to
go to a cheap restaurant, where a whole dinner (such as it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
was) could be bought for fifteen cents. To them it was a
rare treat; but, greatly to their disappointment, Paul did
not enjoy it as they had expected he would.</p>

<p>The afternoon papers were purchased, and even though
their new friend was so wholly unacquainted with the business,
and they were obliged to spend so much of their time
in defending him from the assaults of the more evil disposed
of their calling, trade was more than ordinarily good.</p>

<p>The reckless expenditure of forty-five cents for dinner
was made up, and when the day&rsquo;s work was over they had
a clear profit of forty-three cents; which, to say the least,
encouraged them in their good work.</p>

<p>Instead of going directly to the home that Dickey Spry
had founded, after their day&rsquo;s work was over, Ben proposed
that Paul be introduced to some of their mutual friends, in
order that his change in life might be made as agreeable as
possible, and then came the question as to who should be
honored by the first call.</p>

<p>Ben was in favor of visiting Nelly Green, whose mother
kept a fruit-stand on Chatham Square, and who was always
to be found acting as clerk, while Johnny was anxious to
visit a mutual friend by the name of Mopsey Dowd, who
had risen from boot-black to the proud eminence of owning
a pea-nut stand near Fulton Market.</p>

<p>There was quite an argument as to which one of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
friends Paul would be most pleased to meet, and each one
held so strongly to his own views on the matter that the
question was only settled by the agreement to call on
both.</p>

<p>Mopsey Dowd&rsquo;s place of business being near the corner
where they held their consultation, the three concluded to
visit there first, and Paul was considerably interested in this
work of making acquaintances.</p>

<p>The traffic at the ferry was still quite brisk, and Mopsey
was in the full tide of prosperity, selling his goods as rapidly
as though he had extensively advertised to close out his
entire stock a little below cost.</p>

<p>Between the intervals of waiting upon customers and
turning the roaster to keep the nuts from burning, Ben related
Paul&rsquo;s story to the pea-nut merchant, and Mopsey was
so much interested that he not only favored Paul with a
great deal of his attention, but insisted on presenting him
with a large handful of the very best and warmest nuts.</p>

<p>Mopsey even went so far as to enter into negotiation with
Paul for the purchase of the two tops that had caused him
so much trouble in the getting. But owing to a sudden
rush of customers the proposed trade was broken off, and
the visitors took their leave, promising to call again at
some time when they would be less liable to interruption
from a pea-nut-hungry public.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
Then the three started for Nelly Green&rsquo;s place of business,
taking a roundabout course to get there, for the purpose
of avoiding the crowd; and by doing this they met another
of their acquaintances whom they were rejoiced to see, even
though he was a creditor.</p>

<p>This individual was none other than Master Dickey Spry,
who had earned his last name because of the quickness of
his movements, and who had borne it so long that there was
considerable doubt as to whether he remembered his parents&rsquo;
name or not.</p>

<p>Master Spry was leaning against a lamp-post in an attitude
of deepest dejection, looking down into the gutter as if he
expected to see there some help arise to aid him in his evident
trouble.</p>

<p>Now Dickey Spry was the founder of the house in which
Ben and Johnny took so much pride. He it was who had
discovered that snug place, replete with all needful modern
conveniences, and Ben and Johnny had purchased it of him
for fifty cents, paying ten cents per week on the instalment
plan, and having already made three payments according to
agreement.</p>

<p>Dickey had not noticed them when they first came up,
and it was not until Ben touched him on the shoulder that
he appeared to hear what they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with yer?&rdquo; asked Ben, anxiously.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
&ldquo;You look as if somebody&rsquo;d stole yer an&rsquo; carried yer off.
What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Busted,&rdquo; replied Dickey, mournfully, and then he began
surveying the gutter again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Busted!&rdquo; echoed the two boys in the same breath; and
Ben asked, eagerly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you&rsquo;ve gone up&mdash;failed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest it. I trusted out as much as thirty cents,
an&rsquo; then I got Tim Dooley to &rsquo;tend the stand for me this
forenoon, an&rsquo; when I come back I couldn&rsquo;t find anything
but the stand, an&rsquo; that, you know, I hired. All ther nuts
an&rsquo; Tim had gone off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were so thoroughly overwhelmed by the news
of this misfortune that it was some time before Ben could
ask,</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you find out where Tim is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dickey shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo; everywhere, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t hear nothin&rsquo;
&rsquo;bout him, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t make any of ther fellers pay me what
they owe me, so I&rsquo;m all cleaned out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben looked at Johnny inquiringly for an instant, and when
that young gentleman nodded his head, he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we owe yer twenty cents that ain&rsquo;t due yet, Dickey,
but we&rsquo;ve got ther money, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll pay it to yer now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; replied the unfortunate tradesman, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
I didn&rsquo;t say what I did to make you pay me. If you fellers
will let me own twenty cents&rsquo; worth of ther house I&rsquo;ll be all
right, for then I&rsquo;ll have a place to live, an&rsquo; I kin get back in
ther boot-blackin&rsquo; bizness agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be crowding rather close to put four into the
hogshead; but matters could be arranged by turning their
store-room into a bedchamber, and Dickey&rsquo;s request was
granted without the slightest show of hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; round town awhile,&rdquo; said Johnny to the
bankrupt merchant, &ldquo;an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d better come along with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dickey shook his head very decidedly. He had no desire
to mingle with the world while his loss bore so heavily upon
him, and he was so emphatic in his determination to go
directly to the home he had once sold, that no amount of
persuasion could induce him to change his mind.</p>

<p>After promising to return early, in order to cheer him in
his troubles, the boys continued their interrupted way to
Chatham Square, where, by the greatest good-luck, both
Nelly and her mother were found seated behind a huge
basket piled high with peaches and pears. They were sure
of having a pleasant call at this establishment, for Mrs.
Green could attend to the customers while the daughter
entertained them.</p>

<p>Nelly was rather diffident before this strange boy, who
was dressed so well, and apparently had very little in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
common with the society in which she moved; but after Ben
had given her a detailed account of Paul&rsquo;s circumstances, as
he had to Mopsey, the case seemed entirely changed, and she
was even more sociable with Paul than with her friends.
Johnny and Ben related everything of interest that they
had learned since they had seen Nelly last, and concluded
the recital by an account of Dickey Spry&rsquo;s misfortunes.</p>

<p>Nelly seemed unusually anxious to know how they could
all live in the rather narrow quarters, and after some conversation
regarding it, disclosed the reason of her sudden
interest by informing the boys that since they had called
last her mother had moved, and that their home was larger
than formerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got two rooms that we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t use,&rdquo; continued
Nelly, speaking quickly in her excitement, &ldquo;an&rsquo; mother
thought perhaps you or some of the boys would come up
an&rsquo; board with us. We&rsquo;ll make it just as pleasant for you
as we can, an&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t cost you much more than it does
the way you live now&mdash;an&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t eat more than half
as often as you ought to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul looked up with an expression of pleasure in his
face, for the nearer the hour of retiring approached, the
more distasteful and lonely did the hogshead home seem,
he could say nothing against it, for it had served him as
shelter when he was utterly alone; but this idea of living
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
in a house, where some of the womankind would care for
him, was very agreeable to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother says that she&rsquo;ll board you, an&rsquo; see to your clothes,
an&rsquo; do your washin&rsquo;, for two dollars&rsquo;n a half a week, an&rsquo; I
think it would be awful nice for us all to live together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys thought so too; but they also thought of their
hogshead, which seemed so cheerful to them, if Paul did
have a disdain for it, and there was a momentary feeling
that they would not like to leave it, no matter what inducement
might be offered. Then there arose before them
the vision of a &ldquo;regular home,&rdquo; wherein some one would
care for and minister to their comfort, and the advantages
of living in a hogshead grew very few indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come up to the house in about an hour, an&rsquo; see how
you like it,&rdquo; suggested Nelly, thinking they were hesitating
about accepting the offer. Then, after she had told
them the street and number at which she lived, she added,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be home in a little while now, an&rsquo; then if you should
think that your house is the nicest, you can still live where
you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Ben, decidedly, for he had already
made up his mind that he should accept the proposition.
Then he led the others away very quickly, as if he had
some plan in his mind, as, indeed, he really had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go home an&rsquo; fix up, an&rsquo; then we&rsquo;ll take the eye
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
right outer them, for they think these are the only clothes
we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Johnny was delighted with the proposition of &ldquo;taking the
eye out&rdquo; of Mrs. Green and her daughter by the splendor
of their raiment, and the two walked so fast, in their eagerness
to begin the serious operation of dressing, that Paul
could hardly keep pace with them.</p>

<p>After they had taken the usual precautions to prevent
any one from seeing them when they readied the vicinity
of their home, and had succeeded in getting safely into the
hogshead unobserved, they found the ruined merchant laying
plans for the rebuilding of his shattered fortunes. It
was in vain that they urged him to accompany them on
their call. To all their arguments he had but one reply,
and that was to the effect that he did not believe in their
scheme of boarding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s jest nothin&rsquo; more nor less&rsquo;n tryin&rsquo; to put on airs,&rdquo;
he said, impatiently. &ldquo;Anybody&rsquo;d think you &rsquo;xpected to
be &rsquo;lected aldermen by ther way you&rsquo;re swellin&rsquo; round; an&rsquo;
old Mother Green&rsquo;ll be tickled most to death when she sees
what fools you&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; of yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact it did look just a little as if they were &ldquo;swelling&rdquo;
considerably. Ben blackened Paul&rsquo;s, Johnny&rsquo;s, and
his own boots until they would have answered for mirrors,
and then he attended to his own toilet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
Johnny had red hair, which was quite coarse, and persisted
in growing in all directions at the same time; but
on this occasion he had reduced it to something like subjection
by a vigorous application of the unburned end of
the candle, and it clung to his head as if it had been stuck
there by glue. His freckled face had been scrubbed until
it looked as if it had been polished, and his hands were
almost clean.</p>

<p>But it was upon his costume that he depended for the
greatest effect. That he did have another coat was shown
when he put on one that had evidently been rescued from
the oblivion of an ash-barrel. It was very short-waisted
and very long tailed; but this last defect, if indeed such a
term could be applied, was remedied by one of the skirts
having been cut off at least six inches shorter than the
other, which gave a jaunty, careless appearance to the entire
garment. His vest was the same he wore when at
work; but by pinning the collar over so as to make it present
more of the passably clean shirt, he changed its entire
appearance. The trousers were unaltered, save that where
the lower portions had been fringed by long usage, he had
cut them off as well as he could with his knife. He deeply
mourned the utter absence of a necktie, but consoled himself
with the thought that the invitation had come at such
a late hour in the day, and at a time when his funds were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
so low, that Mrs. Green and Nelly would probably understand
the fact and overlook the omission.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/lbtdn05.jpg" width="600" height="517" alt="" />
<span class="caption">PAUL LOOKED ON AT THESE PREPARATIONS WITH THE MOST PROFOUND SURPRISE.</span>
</div>

<p>Ben was clad in quite as startling a fashion, but in exactly
the opposite way. Johnny&rsquo;s coat was long, very long,
while his was short&mdash;so short as to make it look as if it had
originally belonged to a boy about half his size. His vest
was buttoned snug to the chin, to conceal the ravages made
by dirt on his shirt-front, while his necktie was made of
the very narrowest and most brilliant red ribbon that could
be found.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible to cut anything from
the bottom of his trousers, for the very good reason that
they were already so short as to give them the appearance
of trying to crawl up his legs to get out of sight; but in
his eyes the high polish of his shoes had a better chance
of being seen. Ben&rsquo;s face and hands were as clean as
Johnny&rsquo;s, but he had put none of the candle-grease on his
hair, although he had smoothed it with water until two
small streams were trickling down either side of his face,
giving plenty of employment to his hands, as he tried to
prevent it from running down his neck.</p>

<p>Paul looked on at these preparations with the greatest
surprise; and when his friends announced that they were
ready, and that he was to accompany them, he followed
without a word, awed by the general magnificence.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span></h2>

<h3>A GREAT ENTERPRISE.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>t was not a long walk from the hogshead home to
the house which Mrs. Green proposed to turn into
a place where meals and lodgings could be procured
on a limited scale; but neither Ben nor Johnny lost
any opportunity of stopping to gaze in at the lighted windows
that served as mirrors, in order to make sure that
their attire had not been disarranged in any way by their
rapid walk. And when they stood in front of the door,
it seemed to Paul as if they never would get ready to ring
the bell, so much time did they spend in making sure that
their fine toilets were quite in order, and the general effect
satisfactory.</p>

<p>But they did ring the bell at last, and when Nelly came
to the door there was no mistaking the fact that their
appearance was striking in the highest degree; for the
girl stood regarding them with so much astonishment
that it was some time before she could invite them to
walk in.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
As Ben told Dickey Spry, when they got home that
night, it &ldquo;jest took the eyes outer Mother Green an&rsquo; Nelly
to see them lookin&rsquo; as soft as silk an&rsquo; fine as fiddlers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the embarrassment caused by their costumes had
passed away in a degree, although Nelly did not seem to
recover from her surprise during the entire evening, Mrs.
Green proceeded to the business on hand by showing
the boys two rooms, furnished with no pretensions to elegance,
but as neat as they were bare, which she told them
she would let to four boys at the moderate price of two
dollars and a half each per week, including meals and
washing.</p>

<p>To Paul the difference was so great between the place
and the one they were then occupying, that he was anxious
to go there at once, and the others were quite as eager as he
was. Ben was sure that he could induce Dickey to make
the fourth in that perfection of boarding-houses, as he
knew it would prove to be; and in case he should not succeed
in convincing Master Spry that it would be better for
him to live there rather than in his hogshead, he promised
to use all his eloquence on Mopsey Dowd, or some other
equally eligible party.</p>

<p>Thus it was decided that the boys should change their
home on the following day, and all hands were remarkably
well pleased; Mrs. Green because four boarders would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
bring in a weekly amount of ten dollars, and the boys because
at last they were to live like other people.</p>

<p>It would not be a difficult matter to move, for two coats,
rather the worse for wear, and three old tomato cans were
all the property they had to bring; Paul&rsquo;s tops, which constituted
his baggage, could be carried in the pocket of his
jacket without any trouble.</p>

<p>When they got back to the hogshead that night, and
told Dickey of the important change they were about to
make, he read them a very severe lesson on the sinfulness
of extravagance. It was perhaps a trifle more pointed than
it would have been if he had not just been made bankrupt
by the perfidy of a friend. But it was both time
and labor thrown away to try to induce him to become a
fourth boarder at Mrs. Green&rsquo;s. He positively refused to
listen to the scheme, after it had been described to him,
and the conversation ended by his buying back his old
home at the original price, agreeing to pay ten cents each
week as soon as he should be once more firmly established
in business.</p>

<p>That night Paul had an attack of homesickness; but, being
very tired, he went to sleep before it became so bad as
to be noticed by his friends.</p>

<p>On the following morning Paul went about his work
quite as if he had been accustomed to that sort of thing for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
some time; and owing to the fact that the papers contained
an account of a terrible railroad disaster, trade was remarkably
good with him and Johnny, and correspondingly bad
with Ben. Three times during the morning they sold out
their entire stock, and Paul was so excited by the rush, as
well as the amount of money they were making, that he
quite forgot his troubles.</p>

<p>When dinner-time came, Paul and Johnny had cleared
two dollars and ninety cents, with a fair prospect of making
as much more in the afternoon, since additional particulars
of the accident were being received hourly. Ben had
only made thirty cents; but he and Johnny had always
been in partnership, dividing equally the profits of both,
and the same arrangement held good after Paul was taken
into the concern.</p>

<p>It was decided that Ben should give up his business of
boot-blackening that afternoon, and sell papers with the
others, so he carried his box to a friend who had a fancy-goods
stand in the door-way of an unoccupied store, where
he left it until he should finish his day&rsquo;s work. Each paper
that Paul sold that day had the same advertisement offering
a reward for any tidings of him, but since he never looked
at what his wares contained, save to read the head-lines in
large letters so as to get an idea what he should cry out,
it did him as little good as if it had never been there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
Fortunately for the boys, as the demand for papers was
so great and continued so long, Mrs. Green had set eight
o&rsquo;clock as the hour when they would have dinner. By
this plan she would have plenty of time to cook it, and
all hands would be through work and possessed of plenty
of leisure for eating. Therefore they continued the trade
in news until half-past seven, and then hurried for the last
time to their hogshead, where they found Dickey Spry
eating his supper of crackers and cheese.</p>

<p>The process of finding out exactly how much they had
made was a long and difficult one for both Ben and Johnny.
Each time they counted it over it was with a different result.
When they were very warm, almost angry, and quite
positive that the fault of the difference in reckoning was
in the money itself, Paul took it upon himself to find out
the amount of cash on hand.</p>

<p>Four dollars and eighty-three cents was the grand
total of their earnings that day, and all hands were pleasantly
surprised by the prosperity that had beamed upon
them.</p>

<p>Of course they could not expect such a result except
on days when the papers contained some important news;
but business would be sure to be good on the following
morning, because then all the details of the accident
would have been received. After that perhaps Ben&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
business would have an impetus given it by some friendly
shower.</p>

<p>At the end of the week they would owe Mrs. Green seven
dollars and a half for the board of the firm, and Ben&rsquo;s
proposition was unanimously adopted that they pay four
dollars of that amount in advance, retaining the eighty-three
cents as a working capital for their business the next
day.</p>

<p>There was no attempt made to put on any better appearance
than usual when they started for Mrs. Green&rsquo;s
that night, for now that they were members of her family.
They would be obliged to go there just as they were when
they finished their work, and they might as well show
themselves as they would be on future occasions. Ben attempted
to take quite an elaborate and affecting farewell
of Master Spry, but that young gentleman refused utterly
anything more than the ordinary expressions of parting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be back in less&rsquo;n a month, wantin&rsquo; to live here
agin,&rdquo; he said, as, seated in the farthest corner of the
hogshead, he looked out frowningly at their preparations
for departure. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t swell very long at the rate of
two dollars&rsquo;n half a week, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll be glad to crawl in
here agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben thought that it was not exactly wise to say very
much against this assertion of Dickey&rsquo;s, for it was just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
possible that he was right, and the less that was said about the
matter then the easier it would be to take up their abode
there again in case they were obliged to.</p>

<p>Each of the three boys took a tomato can, while Ben and
Johnny carried, in addition, the coats in which they had arrayed
themselves the night before, and in this manner they
started for their new boarding-house. They were late; but
Mrs. Green, knowing of the activity in the newspaper market,
had expected they would be, and had made her preparations
accordingly.</p>

<p>Paul felt wonderfully relieved at being able to wash himself
with soap once more, and to have a towel to use, while
it seemed as if Ben and Johnny never would make themselves
ready to go to the table, so interested were they in
the very &ldquo;swell&rdquo; thing of combing their hair before a looking-glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell yer it&rsquo;s high!&rdquo; said Ben, emphatically, as he took
up the towel, and then wiped his hands on the skirts of his
coat lest he should soil it&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s high, an&rsquo; if we keep on at
this rate we shall jest spread ourselves all over the block
before we git through with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Johnny shook his head sagely, still unable to stop combing
his hair in front of the glass, as if he wondered where
all this luxury would lead them, while Paul contrasted this
poorly furnished room, which his companions thought so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
magnificent, with what he had been accustomed to at
home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green succeeded in getting her boarders away from
the contemplation of their surroundings by reminding them,
in a very forcible voice, that everything would be spoiled
if they waited much longer. They took their places at the
table, and Ben and Johnny were in a dream of surprise
during the meal, which was, as Ben afterwards told Mopsey,
&ldquo;one of the swellest dinners ever got up in New
York City.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After they had eaten as much as they wanted&mdash;and it
seemed as if they never would get enough, so good did it
taste&mdash;Nelly showed the boarders through the rooms, which
were above a store. There were two floors divided into five
rooms, and an attic which could be of no use except as
a store-room, because of the fact that it was hardly more
than five feet from the floor to the roof.</p>

<p>Ben was highly delighted with everything he saw, Paul
expressed neither surprise nor pleasure, and Johnny was
not enthusiastic until he saw the attic. The moment he
was taken there, a gigantic idea seemed to have come to
him very suddenly, and he stood in the centre of the place
almost too much excited to give words to the thoughts that
crowded upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellers!&rdquo; he cried, and he repeated it twice before he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
could say any more&mdash;&ldquo;fellers! do you know what we can
do up here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it is possible that both Ben and Paul could have
thought of very many things they could do in a space as
large as that attic; but since they did not know what Johnny
referred to, they shook their heads negatively, and waited
for him to tell them what it was that had so excited him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can jest fix things up here, an&rsquo; have a theatre&mdash;a
reg&rsquo;lar theatre, an&rsquo; make more money than&mdash;than&mdash;well, all
we want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then in a very excited way he went on to tell them
just what could be done to transform the place into as beautiful
a theatre, save in one or two unimportant details, as
could be found in the city.</p>

<p>Nelly stood by, looking first at one and then the other of
the boys in mute surprise, while Paul, delighted at the idea
of making a large sum of money at one bold stroke, and
being saved thereby from weary days of waiting and working
before he could return to his home, listened attentively.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">&ldquo;FELLERS! DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO UP HERE?&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Ben agreed with all his partner said, but he advised
that Mrs. Green be consulted as to the scheme before
they went very far in deciding what work they would be
obliged to do in order to transform the place from a rather
dreary attic into a theatre. It then occurred to Johnny
that Mrs. Green might object to such a plan, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
hastened down-stairs to consult with her at once. After considerable
argument, during which he set forth as prominently
as possible the enormous amount of money that
could be earned, of which she should have a fair share,
Johnny succeeded in gaining Mrs. Green&rsquo;s consent to the
plan. After that the boys went to bed, almost too much
excited at the prospect of being managers and proprietors
of a theatre to be able to sleep.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter V.</span></h2>

<h3>MESSRS. TREAT, JONES, WESTON &amp; DOWD.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>he particular circle of society in which Ben and
Johnny moved was shaken to its very centre by the
news which was whispered from one to the other
on the day after those young gentlemen and Paul
had taken up their abode at Mrs. Green&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Early that morning the most exciting topic of conversation
had been Master Spry&rsquo;s misfortune and Tim Dooley&rsquo;s
perfidy; and that had hardly begun to be commented upon
when the news spread that Ben and Johnny, since the
coming of their guest, who was evidently a suspicious sort
of a person, as was shown by his clothes and his entire
ignorance of the slang of the street, were no longer proud
of their neat little bit of real estate, but had made a change
which would probably be the means of their financial ruin.
That they had been so extravagant as to engage rooms at
a regular boarding-house, where they were to spend their
substance on three square meals each day, seemed like a
reckless disregard of money; and the price which they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
to pay for board was stated at various sums from five to
ten dollars per week. But that was not the only bit of
wonderful news.</p>

<p>Jimmy Sullivan stated&mdash;and he was supported by several
others as the time wore on&mdash;that Johnny himself had told
him that they were to start a regular theatre, and had already
engaged a hall, which would be converted into a first-class
place of amusement as soon as possible. This would
have been regarded simply as a rumor started for the purpose
of injuring the credit of these young gentlemen, had
it not come so directly from one of the parties concerned,
and must therefore be true.</p>

<p>Business was in a great measure suspended for that day,
and little knots of boys gathered at the street corners, eagerly
discussing the news which threatened to destroy the credit,
for a time at least, of two merchants who were well known
in boot-blackening and news-selling circles.</p>

<p>It was fully understood by the majority of those who
discussed this startling intelligence, that it was only three
weeks since the firm of Treat &amp; Jones had bought a house
on credit, and that there was still a mortgage of twenty cents
upon it in favor of the now bankrupt merchant, Mr. Dickey
Spry. To be sure, Messrs. Treat &amp; Jones had taken in a
new partner very recently; but there were those who knew
that this new boy had only brought to the firm three cents
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
and two tops, which could not bring in any very large
amount of money, even though a cash customer was found
for them at once. It was very clear that this new partner
was more of a drawback than a help to the firm, and the
mystery seemed greater than ever.</p>

<p>Dickey Spry, on being interviewed on the subject, assumed
a wise air and shook his head gravely; which was
very much as if he had said that he was sorry to see two
promising boys ruining themselves as rapidly as these two
were. Regarding the mortgage which he held on the hogshead
home he refused to say anything, save that he had
bought it back; and those who were better informed regarding
transactions in real estate at once came to the conclusion
that, having foreseen the coming ruin of his debtors,
he had foreclosed the mortgage in order to save what he
could.</p>

<p>Owing to the possibility of his becoming a boarder at
Mrs. Green&rsquo;s, and a partner in the theatrical enterprise,
Mopsey Dowd refused to express any opinion on the matter;
but it was said by those who called upon him that
he turned the handle of his pea-nut roaster nervously and
quickly whenever the subject was mentioned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile those who had caused all these speculations
and doubts were doing their best to sell their goods, and
reaping almost as rich a harvest as they had the day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
previous. They could not fail to notice the singular actions
of their friends, and also that whenever they approached
three or four who were talking earnestly, the conversation
would cease entirely, the boys either walking away or maintaining
a positive silence until they had passed.</p>

<p>It caused them no little surprise, this singular behavior
on the part of their friends; but there was too much money
to be made for them to try to understand it then, and they
continued the sale of their papers, while the others speculated
gloomily as to the future of the rash youths who
would change their positions in life by such hazardous
ventures.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Johnny was the one who was responsible
for all this excitement, since it was he who had
told of the theatrical enterprise. He had been in such a
state of mental excitement since he had first thought of
the scheme, that it was almost an impossibility for him
to get along ten minutes without speaking of it to some
one; and when he told the story he was more apt to
speak of the theatre as he hoped they could arrange it
than as it would probably be. But it must not be supposed
that either Ben or Paul were indifferent to the matter;
they were almost as much excited about it as Johnny was,
though they were not as eager to consult others regarding it.</p>

<p>As has been said, trade was very good that morning, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
when they went home for a lunch, which, by-the-way, they
thought was much better than any of the regular dinners
they had been buying down town, even Mrs. Green was
disposed to think that there might possibly be some chance
that they could do as Johnny had proposed.</p>

<p>It had been their intention to call on Dickey Spry that
evening, for the purpose of trying to cheer him a little in
his troubles; but they were too eager to accomplish their
new scheme to think of spending their time anywhere but
in that famous attic, which was to afford an opportunity
for the display of their histrionic talents as well as to bring
in so much wealth.</p>

<p>It was just as well that they did not adhere to their
original plan, for when Ben explained to Master Spry the
reason why they could not keep their engagement with
him, he gruffly told them that it was just as well, for he
had already made up his mind to go to Jersey City in
search of the defaulter, Tim Dooley. Therefore they were
not troubled with any pangs of conscience because they
were leaving Dickey to mourn alone while they planned
the transformation of the attic, and their dinner was eaten
with a celerity that astonished their landlady. Johnny
took upon himself the duties of architect, and, considering
the difficulties in the way of such labor, the others were
not unwilling that he should hold the office.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
Master Jones found that there was a vast deal of difference
between thinking of what he would like to do in the
way of making improvements, and actually planning how
to make them. He knew that he wanted a stage at one
end of the attic, but when the others waited to hear how
he could go to work to build it with the limited amount
of capital at his disposal, he was almost at a loss to know
what to say or do.</p>

<p>In order that they might set about their work understandingly,
Nelly produced what had originally been a tape-measure
one foot in length. It had seen such hard usage,
however, that only about eight inches remained. With this
the amateur architect set about a portion of his work, which
was to him very painful.</p>

<p>He decided first that it would be a useless waste of material
to build a stage entirely across one end of the attic,
since they would not be crowded from lack of room, owing
to the small number of performers, and after a great amount
of pacing back and forth, as well as mental calculation, he
drew two chalk lines at supposed equal distances from the
walls. Between these lines he measured with his fragment
of a tape-measure, and found that it was exactly thirty times
the length of the tape. Thirty times eight inches was,
therefore, the length of his proposed stage, or, more properly
speaking, his platform, and he seated himself, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
look of perplexity on his face and a remarkably small piece
of lead-pencil in his mouth, to figure up the grand total of
inches. He could multiply the cipher easily enough, for
he was positive that the answer would be the same, however
large the multiplier might be; but the question of
how much eight times three was troubled him greatly.</p>

<p>After trying in vain to arrive at the correct result by
the process of multiplication, he, in his despair, was about
to resort to the tiresome expedient of counting the number
of inches on the tape-measure thirty times over, when Paul
astonished him considerably by giving the result without
even using the pencil and paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How nice that is!&rdquo; said Johnny, with a sigh of relief,
as he wiped from his brow the perspiration that had been
forced out by his mental exertions, and he began to realize
that a knowledge of the multiplication table was very useful
to a person in any line of business.</p>

<p>Paul further informed him that two hundred and forty
inches were twenty feet; and then he proceeded with greater
confidence to calculate the width, which he at first decided
should be twelve feet, but afterwards changed to six when
Ben suggested that they would require too much lumber
if they had it so wide.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>
<img src="images/lbtdn07.jpg" width="600" height="521" alt="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;MULTIPLICATION IS VEXATION.&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>After it was settled that the platform should be raised
two feet from the floor, and Paul had figured up the exact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
number of square feet of lumber which would be necessary
to cover the proposed space, they commenced a serious discussion
as to where the material could be procured.</p>

<p>Ben concluded, finally, that he would call upon a carpenter
whom he knew, from having slept in his shop on the
shavings several cold nights in the winter when he could
find no other shelter, and thus that question was put aside
for the time being.</p>

<p>It would be necessary to have some scenery, and that
Johnny had already arranged for in his mind. He had
decided that it could be made by pasting old newspapers
together, hanging them on strings, and coloring them with
red, green, and black crayons. For this purpose stout cord
was necessary, and Ben went out and bought some, thereby
giving tangible form to their enterprise, for this cord was
really the only thing they had purchased towards effecting
the desired transformation.</p>

<p>Their next step was to gather up all the old newspapers
they could find in the house, and Nelly set about making
some flour paste, while Johnny went in search of the
crayons. Thus they made considerable progress in their
enterprise that night; but it yet lacked a system, and, what
was more important, capital. In order to remedy this,
Johnny called for a strict account of the cash on hand,
since they had been too busy to reckon up that day&rsquo;s sales.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
By common consent Paul was chosen book-keeper, so far
as figuring up the different amounts, whether of money or
material desired, was concerned, and, thanks to his knowledge
of arithmetic, it was not many minutes before he informed
them that the capital of eighty-three cents with
which they had commenced that day&rsquo;s business had been increased
to three dollars and ninety-five cents&mdash;a clear profit
of three dollars and twelve cents. Out of this, one dollar
and a half was given to Mrs. Green towards the payment of
the balance that would be due on their board bill, one dollar
was set apart as the working capital of the theatre, and
sixty-two cents was to be used in business the following day.</p>

<p>They had hardly settled these financial questions when
Mrs. Green&rsquo;s voice from the floor below announced that
Master Mopsey Dowd had called to see them, and was already
on his way up-stairs.</p>

<p>If Master Dowd had had any doubts as to the desirability
of becoming one of Mrs. Green&rsquo;s boarders, they were all
dispelled when he saw that attic, every timber of which
seemed to be begging to be converted into a theatre. In
fact Master Dowd was so impressed with the advantages
of that place as a theatre that he did not even speak to his
friends until he had paced up and down the room, dreaming
of the fame that might be achieved there.</p>

<p>Already the pea-nut merchant seemed to have put all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
thoughts of his roaster and his wares far from him, and
to fancy that he was before an audience of his particular and
critical friends, welcomed by them as an artist of whom all
the world might be proud.</p>

<p>He was recalled from these pleasant dreams by stepping
on a tack that penetrated his shoe at a place where a patch
was much needed, and then he appeared to see for the first
time his friends, who were anxiously waiting for him to
complete his survey of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stunner!&rdquo; he said, patronizingly, to Ben, as he
seated himself on the floor with easy grace, to remove the
tack from his foot&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a stunner! an&rsquo; we can jest set the
boys wild if we can play somethin&rsquo; with plenty of murder
in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll come in with us?&rdquo; asked Johnny, delighted
at the praise of this boy, whom he was anxious to have for
a partner because of the influence he wielded, and also because
it had been whispered among their immediate circle
of friends, not many months before, that Master Dowd had
fixed up a play that &ldquo;laid all over&rdquo; anything that the world
had ever yet seen at the Bowery theatre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll join yer,&rdquo; said Mopsey, impressively, looking
around as if he expected to see every face light up with joy
at his decision&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join yer, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll come here to board to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
Then, as was perfectly proper, this new partner was informed
of the amount of cash capital on hand; and after
Paul had ascertained that their dollar represented thirty-three
and one-third cents as the share of each one, Mopsey
generously counted out thirty-four cents, disdaining any
credit for the extra two-thirds of a cent. Thus it was that
the firm of Treat, Jones, Weston &amp; Dowd sprang into existence.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter VI.</span></h2>

<h3>THE THEATRICAL ENTERPRISE.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>hen it became known among that portion of
the mercantile world of which Ben and Johnny
were members that Mopsey Dowd, the pea-nut merchant
of Fulton Ferry, had connected himself with
the theatrical enterprise about which so many comments
had been made, the matter put on an entirely different aspect,
and it was at once shrewdly guessed that he had put
in the greater portion of the working capital.</p>

<p>There no longer seemed to be any doubt as to the success
of the enterprise, and Ben, Johnny, and Paul found their
regular business seriously interfered with by those of their
acquaintances who were anxious to become actors. Had
they given a position to each of their friends who asked
for one, they would have been obliged to have given the
entertainment without an audience, for all their acquaintances
would have been employed in the theatre.</p>

<p>Master Dowd had foreseen this difficulty, and before he
had been a member of the firm five minutes he decided
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
that no actors outside the firm should be employed, and that
Nelly should do something towards the entertainment, probably
in the way of a song. As to ticket-sellers, door-keepers,
ushers, and such officers, Mopsey felt reasonably certain
that Mrs. Green would consent to take her knitting and fill
all the positions by sitting at the door, where she could collect
the money for admissions, keep the audience in order,
and keep a general eye to the safety of her house, all at the
same time.</p>

<p>Thus, when any one pleaded old friendship, or services
rendered, as a reason why they should be admitted as members
of the company, everything was made plain and pleasant
by referring to the mutual agreement that prevented
any more actors, however brilliant they thought they were,
from being engaged.</p>

<p>The public, or a certain portion of it, were more than
anxious to know what the opening play was to be, and many
inquiries were made of the first three of the partners, even
before they had succeeded in procuring the material for
the stage. Finally they spoke to Mopsey about it, for they
thought the curiosity of their expected patrons should be
satisfied.</p>

<p>Owing to its being generally understood that Mopsey
was an author, making dramatic literature a specialty, the
other partners, advised by Nelly Green, had left the important
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
question of what the opening play should be entirely
to the pea-nut merchant. When he was questioned on the
subject by his partners, he refused to give them any information
save that he was thinking up something which would
go ahead of anything yet written, and that he would make
the result of his thoughts known in due time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the boys continued their regular business, for
they had wisely concluded that it would not do to let the
theatrical enterprise interfere with that which they knew
would provide them a living, until the new scheme had been
shown a success.</p>

<p>Paul had become quite proficient in the work of selling
newspapers, and although he had not overcome the feeling
of homesickness which would creep over him every night,
he was becoming more reconciled to his lot, because each
day&rsquo;s work seemed to bring him nearer to the attainment
of his object.</p>

<p>Ben and Johnny had forgotten their plan of writing a
letter to some of Paul&rsquo;s friends, or of proposing that he
should do it, because of the great scheme of the theatre;
and if either of them thought of it after it had first been
spoken of, it was only as a useless labor, since, as soon as
their place of amusement was open, they would all have
money enough to go anywhere they wanted to.</p>

<p>Business had been as good as they could have expected.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
Of course they did not have such a rush as they had been
favored with during the first two days that Paul was in
partnership with them, because the news was not so exciting;
but they did so well that their board was paid for
a week before they had been at Mrs. Green&rsquo;s four days,
and they had begun to think of adding to the theatrical
fund.</p>

<p>Ben had heard of a small lot of timber which could be
purchased for one dollar and a half, and Johnny insisted
that each member of the firm be called upon for an addition
of forty cents to his regular investment, which demand
was promptly met. In four days the work on the scenery
had advanced so well that Johnny felt sure enough papers
had been pasted together, at least until after the stage had
been built, and the timber was purchased and carried into
the attic at once. It was no slight work to build the stage
to their satisfaction, and the four labored hard two entire
evenings before it was completed. But when it was up,
they were fully repaid for all they had done, so thoroughly
business-like did it look, and such a theatrical appearance
it gave to the attic.</p>

<p>To be sure, one end was a few inches higher than the
other, and there were not boards enough to floor the space
completely over; but the first defect could and would be
remedied by the scenery, and the second could be gotten
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
over by a little extra care when they walked. Besides,
Mopsey was not just certain but that those very holes could
be utilized by him in his construction of the play for some
very startling and novel effects.</p>

<p>The painting of the scenery was an artistic bit of work,
which Johnny was certain he and Nelly, with perhaps some
trifling assistance from Paul, could do in such a manner
as would delight their patrons and cover themselves with
credit. Therefore that portion of the work was left entirely
in their hands one evening, while Ben and Mopsey
started out to call on Dickey Spry for the purpose of consulting
with him as to how they could procure material
with which to build seats, for Dickey was supposed to be
quite an authority in such matters.</p>

<p>Very little had been seen of Master Spry by this firm of
dramatic managers, authors, and actors since the night on
which he had purchased his old home. He had gone back
to the business of blackening boots, as he had said he
should; but he was plying his trade in Jersey City, in the
hope that he might learn of the whereabouts of the boy
who had ruined him. Therefore it was only right that
they should call upon him, because of their friendship, even
if they had not wanted his advice. With this twofold purpose
in view they started out, fearing that they should not
find him at home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
But their fears were groundless, for when they reached
the hogshead, Master Spry was discovered at a feast of herrings
and crackers. He was not a boy who indulged in any
useless conversation; and when he saw who his visitors
were, he welcomed them by passing to each a herring and
a cracker, which was really more eloquent than words.</p>

<p>While he was eating, Ben glanced around, in order to see
what changes the new occupant had made. The only unfamiliar
thing he saw was a large sheet of brown paper tacked
up at the end of the hogshead. On this paper was printed
the following notice, the letters having evidently been made
by a chewed stick, with liquid blacking considerably diluted
with water:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="text01_return" id="text01_return"></a>
<img src="images/lbtxt01.png" width="500" height="376"
alt="Text of the note" longdesc="#text01" />
<span class="caption">[<a href="#text01">Go to text version</a>.]</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
It is impossible to say what good Master Spry thought
he could effect by having this notice put up in his own
home, where no one would see it but his friends, who knew
all the particulars; but it seemed to afford him a great deal
of satisfaction to look at it, which Ben concluded was the
reason why he had done it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t heard nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout Tim?&rdquo; asked Ben, after he
and Mopsey had spelled the notice out with considerable
difficulty, and many misgivings as to whether Jersey should
be spelled with a G or a J.</p>

<p>Dickey shook his head and tried to sigh; but he had
such a large piece of herring in his month that he did not
dare to attempt it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;xpect I ever shall,&rdquo; he said, sadly, as soon as he
had swallowed enough of the fish to admit of his speaking
plainly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve offered to give ten cents, jest as I&rsquo;ve got it
there, if anybody will tell me where he is; but I don&rsquo;t hear
nothin&rsquo; of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben and Mopsey sat for a few moments in silence, as if
to better express their sympathy, and then the latter asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s biz, Dick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t so awful good, nor it ain&rsquo;t so dreadful
bad,&rdquo; was the non-committal reply. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I shall get
along; but I wish I could git a holt of Tim Dooley; then
I&rsquo;d be pretty well fixed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
The visitors looked as if they thought it would be of
very little advantage to Dickey if he should succeed in
finding the defaulter, and Dickey said, quickly, as if they
had spoken their doubts,</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can catch him, I&rsquo;ll make him pay me back somehow,
whether he&rsquo;s got it or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was rather a rash assertion; but Dickey spoke so confidently
that his visitors thought it best not to argue the
question, and Ben concluded that it was about time to proceed
with the business for which they had come. After he
had explained just what it was they needed for the completion
of their theatre, during which time Dickey sat rubbing
his chin, the personification of wisdom, the two waited
for Master Spry to give them the benefit of his knowledge.</p>

<p>It was some time before he condescended to speak; but
when he did, it was slowly and emphatically, to show that
his mind was fully made up, and could not be changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where there&rsquo;s a lot of boards that I could trade
for, an&rsquo; you could put some blocks under each end of them,
an&rsquo; have the best kind of seats. But, yer see, I&rsquo;ve bin
thinkin&rsquo; that you oughter taken me inter company with yer,
for I can act all round anybody you&rsquo;ve got in that crowd.
Now I&rsquo;ll git all ther seats yer want, an&rsquo; carry &rsquo;em up there,
if you&rsquo;ll let me come in with yer.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/lbtdn08.jpg" width="589" height="600" alt="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;HOW&rsquo;S BIZ, DICK?&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>It was a sudden proposal, and the two did not know what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
to say for some moments. It was gratifying to them, because
Master Spry was very cautious in making any venture,
and that he was anxious to become a partner showed
that the public looked with favor upon the scheme, or
Dickey Spry would have been the last boy to propose partnership.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But each one of us have put in seventy-three cents,&rdquo;
said Mopsey, hesitatingly, after he had thought the matter
over for several moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; I git as many as twenty long boards, an&rsquo; the
blocks to put under &rsquo;em, won&rsquo;t that be a good deal more&rsquo;n
that much money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judging from the price they had paid for the timber
with which the stage had been built, they knew that Dickey&rsquo;s
offer was a good one; and after that young gentleman
had gone out into the yard in order to allow them to discuss
the matter privately, Mopsey said, as they called him
back,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re willin&rsquo; to &rsquo;gree to it, an&rsquo; take you in with us;
but of course we&rsquo;ve got to see what Johnny an&rsquo; Polly say to
it, an&rsquo; if you&rsquo;ll come over to the house with us, we&rsquo;ll fix the
thing right up quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By way of reply, Dickey jammed his hat more firmly on
his head, and extinguished the candle&mdash;which actions his
visitors understood to mean that he would accompany them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
During the walk Ben was anxious to know where and
how Master Spry was going to procure this lumber which
he offered for an interest in the concern; but Dickey did
not hesitate to say that he would not tell them until after
the question as to whether he was to be a partner or not had
been settled, lest they should take advantage of the information,
and then refuse to make him an equal owner.</p>

<p>This seemed to cast a doubt upon their honesty; but
they did not take offence at it, because Master Spry was
suffering from the wickedness of a boy whom he had trusted,
and it was only natural that he should be suspicious.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Mrs. Green&rsquo;s, and ascended to the
attic which was the scene of so much industry, they found
that the amateur artists had made great progress in their
work, although it was shown more by the dense coloring
that had been put on the newspaper scenery than from any
very fine effects.</p>

<p>Johnny had two wide strips of paper, completely covered
with patches of black and green, that were to be placed
either side of the stage where the audience would see them,
as one sees the wings at a more pretentious theatre. He
pointed to his work with evident satisfaction, and assumed
an injured look when neither one of the new-comers understood
that it was a very fine representation of a forest.</p>

<p>Paul and Nelly were industriously engaged in coloring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
two other wings with alternate stripes of red and blue; but
their work was not sufficiently advanced to render it possible
to form any idea as to what it was, and they refused
to give any information until they had finished it.</p>

<p>After the coloring of the scenery had been admired, and
Dickey had examined with a critical eye all that had been
done, Ben stated to Johnny and Paul the proposition which
Master Spry had made, declaring himself in favor of accepting
it.</p>

<p>Of course, after the advantages of this new connection
had been explained, the artists were perfectly willing to
admit Mr. Spry as a partner, and he was informed of the
fact, with the intimation that it was necessary to have the
seats there as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Dickey promised to begin his labor on the following
morning; and then, while the others worked on the scenery,
he related to them the success he should make as an actor,
provided he was given a part which admitted of his carrying
a sword and shield.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter VII.</span></h2>

<h3>ARTISTS AND PRINTERS.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapd"><span class="dropcap">D</span></span>ickey Spry kept his word, so far as having
the timber for the seats at the theatre was concerned;
for so anxious was he to fulfil his part
of the contract that he devoted all the next afternoon
and evening to the work.</p>

<p>He made arrangements with Mrs. Green, whereby he
could get into the house during the afternoon while she
was attending to her fruit-stand, and by nine o&rsquo;clock in
the evening he had made seats enough to accommodate at
least two hundred boys, providing, of course, that they were
willing to stow themselves in snugly.</p>

<p>After the work was done, there was not a member of
the firm but thought they had a valuable acquisition in
the person of Mr. Spry and his timber, and they listened
with more attention to his suggestions than they had on
the previous evening, when it was possible that he would
not carry out his portion of the contract as fully as they
desired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
When they stopped work that evening they surveyed
their theatre with a great deal of pride; for it was now
so nearly completed that any one could tell, at a very
searching glance, what it was intended for. The scenery
was all in its place, and Nelly had made a quantity of
rosettes out of tissue-paper of various colors, which were
to be fastened as ornaments on the rough, unpainted
boards.</p>

<p>All that remained to be done was to make the curtain,
and hang it so that it could be rolled up and down, and
to arrange a place for the candles that were to serve as
foot-lights.</p>

<p>What that curtain should be made of had been a vexing
question for the partners to settle, and many and serious
had been the discussions regarding it. Ben had insisted
that they ought to buy white cloth enough to make a regular
curtain; but, on considering that proposition carefully,
they had discovered that it would cost nearly three dollars,
and they hardly felt warranted in going to so much
expense.</p>

<p>Finally, it was decided to buy large sheets of stout
brown paper, which could be both pasted and sewed together,
in order to make sure that they would not pull
apart by their own weight, and then these were to be ornamented
in some artistic manner by each one of the party.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
By the time this important question was settled, it was
so late that no more work could be done that night; but
before Dickey departed for his hogshead home there was
an emphatic demand made upon Mr. Dowd for some particulars
as to the play which he had promised to have in
readiness for the opening night. It was then Wednesday;
and since the first performance was to be given on the
following Saturday evening, it did surely seem as if the
actors should know what they were to do on that important
occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be all right,&rdquo; Mopsey said, so decidedly that
they would have been obliged to be satisfied, even if he
had not added, &ldquo;Friday night we&rsquo;ll all come here an&rsquo; practise,
an&rsquo; then I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the following day business was so good that it was
very late before any of the partners could get to work on
their theatrical enterprise, and if their profits had not been
so large, they would have deeply regretted the delay. But
they worked the faster when they did get the chance;
and while the others were interested in putting together
the curtain, which bid fair to be a marvel of art, Ben labored
industriously at making the tickets.</p>

<p>An acquaintance of his had a large lot of card-board
clippings, which he had gathered from time to time as he
delivered papers in a printing-office, and these Ben had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
purchased, with the understanding that he was to give free
admission to the entertainment for them during three evenings,
providing, of course, that the theatre remained open
to the public that length of time. From these odds and
ends Nelly had cut about a hundred tickets during the
afternoon while she was in charge of the fruit-stand, and
these Ben was converting into orders for admission by
printing on them, in rather a shaky hand, and with a new
lead-pencil he had bought for that express purpose, the
following:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="text02_return" id="text02_return"></a>
<img src="images/lbtxt02.png" width="500" height="166"
alt="Text of the note" longdesc="#text02" />
<span class="caption">[<a href="#text02">Go to text version</a>.]</span>
</div>

<p>As it was proposed to charge eight cents for seats in
the two front benches, Ben printed, in addition to the
above, twenty very unique cards, similar to this:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="text03_return" id="text03_return"></a>
<img src="images/lbtxt03.png" width="500" height="111"
alt="Text of the note" longdesc="#text03" />
<span class="caption">[<a href="#text03">Go to text version</a>.]</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
It was a long job, and he had bitten his tongue until it
was sore in his efforts to make the printing legible, while
his fingers ached from clutching the pencil so firmly;
but he finished his task before the curtain was completed,
and was able to give his advice as to the embellishment
of it.</p>

<p>It was while working on the curtain that Johnny displayed
his skill as an artist, for he assumed the sole charge
of it, insisting that the others should proceed under his
direction. It was spread on the floor, and Hunter Jones was
pursuing his work on his hands and knees, with two candles
stuck in bottles as his only light. But Johnny appeared
to be equal to the emergency, for he was dashing on the
color rapidly, not heeding the fact that one side of his nose
was a beautiful green, and the other a vivid red, while his
chin was as black as if he had been trying to paint a beard
on it.</p>

<p>It was on the central figure of this intended work of art
that Johnny was expending the most of his labors, and
to those who were watching him it appeared something
like an eccentric rainbow, or the interior of a paint-shop,
until Master Jones printed under it, to avoid any possibility
of mistake, &ldquo;WiLD iNGuN,&rdquo; and then all could see the
resemblance at once.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>
<img src="images/lbtdn09.jpg" width="600" height="511" alt="" />
<span class="caption">ALL COULD SEE THE RESEMBLANCE AT ONCE.</span>
</div>

<p>Johnny was proud of his work, and when at last it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
completed, he stood at some distance from it, transfixed with
silent admiration of what he had created, and quite regardless
of the fact that the hot tallow from the candle which
he held in his hand was running down over his fingers.</p>

<p>It had been decided to have a small painting in each of
the four corners, to prevent the Indian from looking lonely,
and one of these was to be done by each member of the
firm.</p>

<p>Paul drew his entirely in black, in the right-hand lower
corner, and it was a very fair representation of two guns
and a sword, although the barrels of the guns were rather
more crooked than they should have been, while the edge
of the sword was notched, as if it had had some hard
usage.</p>

<p>Dickey printed in red the same notice that the boys had
seen in his home, offering a reward for the apprehension of
Tim Dooley; and although his partners declared that it was
not at all appropriate for the curtain of a dramatic stage,
he insisted that it should remain there, citing as an argument
the fact that he had contributed more than the others
to the general fund. It was an argument that could not be
disputed, and Dickey&rsquo;s notice was allowed to remain, although
Johnny contended that the audience would think his Indian
had been intended as a portrait of the missing Tim.</p>

<p>In the upper left-hand corner Mopsey painted, with all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
the colors at his command, a picture of a schooner under
full sail, with a row of what was at first supposed to be
guns showing over the rail, but which he explained were
pea-nuts, adding that she was represented as having a full
cargo on board.</p>

<p>Ben, with fingers still aching from severe exertion with
the pencil, drew a picture of his blacking-box and brush,
which would have been quite a correct likeness if he had
not made the mistake of painting the brush nearly three
times as large as the box.</p>

<p>Then, in order that Nelly might do something towards
beautifying this wonderful curtain, she was allowed to print
the name of each member of the firm, as well as her own,
around the border, giving more color to the whole, even if
it did not add to the artistic effect.</p>

<p>It was very late when all this was done, and the promoters
of this grand enterprise were obliged to go to their
respective beds, much as they would have liked to continue
at their work all night.</p>

<p>The hundred and twenty tickets were divided equally
among the five partners, that they might sell as many
as possible before the opening of the doors on Saturday
night, and thus lessen Mrs. Green&rsquo;s duties as door-keeper.</p>

<p>It was also agreed before they separated that night, that
Ben and Dickey should not attempt to do any business the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
next day, but devote all their time to banging the curtain
and hunting up old bottles to use as holders for the foot-lights,
so that everything would be in readiness for the rehearsal
in the evening.</p>

<p>During the next forenoon, those of the partners who pursued
their regular business had all they could do to attend
to those who wished to buy papers and theatre tickets, and
more particularly the latter.</p>

<p>There had been very much talk and speculation among
this portion of the news-selling world as to the theatre, and
every one was anxious to secure a ticket as early as possible,
lest if they delayed until near the time of the performance
they should be unable to gain admission.</p>

<p>Of course where so much had been said about any one
particular thing as was said about this theatre, and where
so many rumors were flying around, exaggeration as to the
size, furnishing, and general appearance of the place could
not be prevented. Some thought that an army of carpenters
had been at work fitting up and decorating the whole
theatre; others had it that it was upon the stage only that
much labor had been expended, and that that portion of
the theatre was more beautiful than any other that could
be found in the city.</p>

<p>The more imaginative paid no attention to mere detail,
but circulated the most startling rumors as to the excessive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
amount of brain-work Mopsey Dowd was doing on
the new play, which was to be his masterpiece, and to far
surpass anything Buffalo Bill or Sixteen-string Jack ever
wrote.</p>

<p>Since Mopsey was found at his place of business with
the same regularity as before this gigantic scheme was
planned, some of his admirers insisted that he worked
nights, spending the time when he should have been asleep
in bringing forth the most startling and blood-curdling
scenes, to be given with all their attendant horrors on the
night of the opening of the theatre.</p>

<p>With all these things to give an impetus to the sale of
tickets, it was little wonder that they were disposed of
readily. When night came, all had been sold save those
which Ben and Dickey had, and the demand was still very
great.</p>

<p>Each member of the company was quite as much excited
when they went home that night as if the performance
was to be given then, for the rehearsal was to be held, and
all had their parts to learn.</p>

<p>Ben and Dickey had worked faithfully, and performed
all that had been given them to do. The curtain was
hung, a little awkwardly, to be sure, on account of the uneven
manner in which the stage was built; but there it
was, whether straight or crooked, where all the beauty of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
its many-colored illustrations could be seen if the candles
were held near enough to it.</p>

<p>When called upon to hoist and lower it, Ben and Dickey
showed evident signs of nervousness; but they succeeded,
after some considerable time, in getting it up and down
without tearing it, although it was plain to be seen that
they were relieved when it was up for the second time, and
Mopsey had ordered it left there.</p>

<p>The foot-lights had been arranged by nailing narrow strips
of board on the under side of the stage, and allowing them
to project about six inches beyond where the curtain would
come when it was lowered. On these strips the bottles,
some large and some small, were to be placed, each with a
candle in it. Ben was confident that they would remain
there safely enough, provided no one walked very heavily
on the stage; he also suggested to Mopsey that he should
have as little fighting as possible in the play, because of
the insecurity of these bottle foot-lights. This piece of advice,
however, caused the author to frown severely, as if he
felt that some of his best scenes would thus be interfered
with.</p>

<p>No one had thought of lighting the main body of the
hall until Ben and Dickey noticed the omission, and supplied
it by tying candles around two barrel-hoops, and hanging
them up like chandeliers, which added greatly to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
general appearance and finish of the place. After all these
things had been inspected the party adjourned to dinner, in
order to fortify themselves for the trying mental labor before
them, and Dickey remained as the guest of his partners,
having been specially invited by them and Mrs. Green.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII.</span></h2>

<h3>AN AUTHOR&rsquo;S TRIALS.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>hen the dinner was ended&mdash;and the members of
the dramatic company made short work of it in
order to begin their professional duties as soon as
possible&mdash;Mopsey Dowd fully realized that he was
about to pass in judgment before his partners. Whether
he was entitled to it or not, he had some considerable fame as
an author, and for that reason he had taken upon himself,
voluntarily and even eagerly, the task of preparing an original
play for the great event; which goes to show, perhaps,
more than anything else, that Mopsey&rsquo;s fame resulted from
chance rather than merit.</p>

<p>When he rose from the table he knew that every eye
was upon him, and that each one present expected to hear
him say something relative to the brain-effort he was making.
He was a genius, and would be until his friends found
him out, which occurrence would not be very far off if he
should say anything then, for the very good reason that he
did not know what to say. He knew that something must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
be done, and that speedily, which would bear out his claim
to distinction, and, with a view to gaining time, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fellers go into the theatre, &rsquo;cause I ain&rsquo;t quite
ready yet, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go up to my room to think over one or
two things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech was very much needed just then, for Mopsey
had been so reticent as to his play that his partners
were beginning to suspect that he was not all he claimed
to be. But now perfect trust was restored by his words,
and the proprietors of the theatre went up to their temple
of art feeling every confidence in the author who was struggling
in the privacy of his chamber for their success.</p>

<p>This delay in the beginning of the rehearsal was just
what Nelly wanted, for it enabled her to add what she considered
would be the crowning beauty of their decorations.
She had conceived the idea only that afternoon, while engaged
in the busy whirl of keeping the sound peaches at
the top of the basket and the unripe ones at the bottom.</p>

<p>A friend of hers, whose mother kept a thread-and-needle
emporium that was contained in a willow basket, and displayed
to the public very near her fruit-stand, was skilful
in the art of making paper flowers, and from time to time
had presented Nelly with specimens of her skill, until everything
in the house that could be pressed into service as a
vase was filled with these never-fading and odorless roses.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
It had occurred to her that these flowers might be so arranged
on the wall as to form the word &ldquo;Welcome;&rdquo; and
when she suggested her idea to the boys, after Mopsey had
gone into his room, they were delighted. Therefore the
delay caused by the author enabled them to go to work upon
this last and most beautiful of their decorations at once.</p>

<p>Dickey went out for a paper of tacks, and Johnny drew
on the wall, directly opposite the entrance of the hall, the
outlines of the word to be filled up with the paper flowers.
But there was a difference of opinion among those who
were watching him as to how the word should be spelled.
He had drawn out the letters &ldquo;Welkum,&rdquo; while Paul insisted
that it was not right, spelling the word correctly, and
referring the matter to Ben for arbitration.</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, as if he was an authority in such matters,
Ben looked wonderfully wise, but refused to give any
decision until after he had written the word down on a bit
of paper, spelling it in various ways, that he might see
which looked correct.</p>

<p>After some moments of anxious suspense for Johnny, for
he had built a very frail stand to enable him to reach a
point on the wall where it would be impossible for any of
the audience to tear the flowers down, Ben announced
that neither was correct, and that the word should be
spelled &ldquo;Wellcom.&rdquo; It was in vain that Paul insisted Ben
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
was wrong. The decision had been given, and the others
decided that where a matter was left to a third party for
adjustment all must be satisfied with the ruling. Therefore
Johnny marked out the letters as Ben had said, and after
Dickey&rsquo;s return with the tacks the flowers were put up,
forming a very gorgeous and badly spelled word.</p>

<p>Before the partners had finished admiring this very beautiful
ornament on the wall of their theatre, a noise was
heard on the stairs, and, on looking out, Dickey announced,
by many frantic gestures, that the author was coming. It
was a moment of anxious expectancy, for at last they were
to know the result of their partner&rsquo;s labors, and they were
to be shown just what they were to do on the important occasion.
Dickey was particularly anxious, probably fearing
lest his part should not be such as would admit of his carrying
a sword and shield.</p>

<p>Mopsey walked into the room with slow and measured
step, as if he knew the weight of the words he was about to
speak, and feared lest, being too heavy, they might topple
him over. But Master Dowd was not one who did anything
in a careless manner; he did not deign to speak
until he had walked the length of the room, disappeared
behind the scenery, and stalked out upon the stage, holding
a huge sheet of paper in his hand as if it was a weapon
with which he was about to strike any refractory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
member of the firm, should his play not be exactly to their
liking.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;WHO PUT THAT UP?&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Fellers,&rdquo; he said, as he cleared his throat, and then
noticing the female portion of his company, he corrected
himself by saying, &ldquo;Fellers an&rsquo; Nelly: When we first made
up our minds to build this theatre&mdash;&rdquo; Here he waved his roll
of paper around as if to designate which theatre he meant.
The movement drew his attention to the new ornament, and
caused him to forget what he was about to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who put that up?&rdquo; he asked, almost angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Johnny, and then, anxious to shift any responsibility
of the spelling to the shoulders on which it belonged,
he added, &ldquo;but Ben spelled it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, fix it,&rdquo; commanded the disturbed author. &ldquo;If any
of the fellers should see that they&rsquo;d think we didn&rsquo;t know
nothin&rsquo; at all. Put it w-e-double l-k-o-m.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Johnny started to obey him, thinking with delight that
he had been almost right before, and Mopsey continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we built this place I said I&rsquo;d fix up a play myself,
so&rsquo;s we&rsquo;d be sure to have everythin&rsquo; all right; but business
has been so good, an&rsquo; I had so much trouble with my pea-nut
roaster&mdash;for I broke it twice, an&rsquo; had to hire one offer
the Italian that keeps across the street&mdash;that I thought we&rsquo;d
play somethin&rsquo; the boys all knew, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;d kinder lay over
anythin&rsquo; they&rsquo;d ever seen at the same time. So I thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
we&rsquo;d play the whole of Shakespeare, an&rsquo; that would give
everybody a fair show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a look of disappointment on the faces of
his hearers as he said this, and noticing it, he added,
quickly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see we couldn&rsquo;t get up a whole play new, an&rsquo; give
all hands a chance to do fightin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; then, agin, Dickey
wouldn&rsquo;t have a shield an&rsquo; a sword any other way than
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last argument changed the look on Dickey&rsquo;s face at
once, and he was perfectly satisfied with any arrangement
now, for he knew that his ambition was to be realized. The
others were very careful to show no signs of approval until
they were satisfied that they had been treated as well as
Dickey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued Mopsey, as he looked around at
his audience much as if he expected to hear some of them
say that he couldn&rsquo;t write a play, &ldquo;the first thing we had to
have was a programme, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve made one out, so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ll
know jest what you&rsquo;ve got to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mopsey unfolded the paper he had carried in his
hand, and displayed a bill of the play. It is unnecessary to
say that this piece of literary work had cost the author a
very great effort. Doubts as to the spelling arose at every
turn, but the final result was as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">[<a href="#text04">Go to text version</a>.]</span>
</div>

<p>Mopsey waited patiently until all had read this wonderful
production, and he was pleased to see that nearly all were
satisfied with their parts. Ben Treat was the only one who
appeared to think he had any cause for complaint, and he
very soon made his grievance known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t play ghost,&rdquo; he said, fretfully; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout it, an&rsquo; I want more to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mopsey had made up his mind as to what course he
should pursue in case of any dissatisfaction, and he said to
Ben, in tones of deepest scorn,</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great feller you are to get up a fuss before you know
what you&rsquo;ve got to do! an&rsquo; you oughter be ashamed of yourself.
Why, you&rsquo;ve got an awful lot to do. In the first
place, you&rsquo;ve got to come an&rsquo; &rsquo;most scare the life out of
Polly, an&rsquo; then when he runs away you&rsquo;ve got to do a song
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
an&rsquo; dance, an&rsquo; turn three or four hand-springs before you
sink right down through one of these holes, I don&rsquo;t know
what you do want if that don&rsquo;t suit you, unless it is to do
the whole play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben had nothing more to say; he realized that his was
really an important part, and he was abashed by the withering
sarcasm of the angry author. Then each of the others,
fearing lest they should not have as good an opportunity
for the display of their talents, demanded to know what
they were to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll begin an&rsquo; tell you the whole thing,&rdquo; said Mopsey,
as he prepared to show how all of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays
could be performed on one evening by a small company.
&ldquo;In the first place, Nelly comes out, all dressed up, an&rsquo; sings
a song; then the play commences. I come out with a
sword an&rsquo; pistols, an&rsquo; tell about my hoss runnin&rsquo; away, an&rsquo;
after I get through, Shiner comes out an&rsquo; picks a fuss with
me, an&rsquo; I kill him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the speaker was interrupted by the gentleman who
had been selected to play the part of Othello, with the remark
that it was hardly fair to dispose of him at such an
early stage of the performance, more especially on the first
night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you come on agin an&rsquo; dance,&rdquo; said Mopsey, fretfully.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you wait till I get through? After I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
kill Shiner, Dickey comes in an&rsquo; we two have a reg&rsquo;lar fight,
an&rsquo; we both run away. Then Shiner jumps up an&rsquo; dances
just as long as he can, an&rsquo; down comes the curtain. In the
next act Polly comes out an&rsquo; talks a lot of stuff; an&rsquo; when
he gets through, Ben comes right up through the floor an&rsquo;
scares him awfully. An&rsquo; when he runs off, Ben does a song
an&rsquo; dance, an&rsquo; that ends that act. Then Nelly sings another
song, an&rsquo; we all come out fightin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; when we get through,
Dickey dances a clog; an&rsquo; if that ain&rsquo;t show enough for five
cents, I don&rsquo;t know what is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact the partners were of Mopsey&rsquo;s opinion, and since
they were all to appear in the last act in a grand fight, they
would not have complained even though it had been necessary
for them all to die in the first scene. Even if Mopsey
had not written an original play, he had covered himself
with glory in this arrangement of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works; and
if there had been any doubts as to the success of their enterprise,
they were dispelled now.</p>

<p>Of course it was necessary to make some arrangements
for costumes, and an exciting discussion began at once, during
which Mrs. Green was called upon to see what she
could do towards fitting the party out. Mopsey proposed
that a further assessment of twenty-five cents be made upon
each of the company, and announced that, prosperous as
business was just then, he had decided to shut up shop the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
next day, in order to give his whole attention to the important
work of preparation. Dickey volunteered to sacrifice
his business also, in order to aid him, and it was believed
that with the funds just raised these two could buy and hire
weapons enough to arm the entire party.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green had several things which it was thought could
be used with good effect, and all hands went to work making
wooden swords, in case there should be any trouble in
finding the real articles. Nelly made more tickets, so that
all who were anxious to witness the performance might at
least have one, and Paul was given charge of the money
that had been received thus far; for all were anxious to see
the entire receipts of that night&rsquo;s performance in one unbroken
whole, even if it was necessary to advance funds
from each individual pocket in order to make the necessary
purchases. And during the remainder of that evening
Mopsey rehearsed the different members of the combination
separately, until he was convinced that they could carry out
their respective <i>roles</i> perfectly.</p>

<h3>THE MOMENTOUS OCCASION.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcaph"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>owever successful a venture the opening of a
theatre might prove to the five boys interested, it
was quite evident, before that eventful Saturday
had passed, that it would seriously injure their regular
business. At least half their time that day was spent
in answering the questions of intending patrons, or those
who had already purchased their tickets; and of course
while they were thus engaged they could not sell papers or
blacken boots. Therefore, when they stopped work at five
o&rsquo;clock, according to agreement, so that they would be sure
to have time to dress before eight, they had not made more
than ten cents apiece. They did not realize what this loss
of time had cost them, for nearly all of the tickets had been
sold, and in contemplating the theatrical receipts, those that
should have come from the legitimate business were entirely
lost sight of. There was every prospect that they would
have a large audience, and when they went to Mrs. Green&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
they congratulated themselves on having thought of such a
brilliant project.</p>

<p>That Mopsey was a thoughtful manager, as well as sparkling
author, was shown by a notice which the boys found
fastened to the street-door. It read:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="text05_return" id="text05_return"></a>
<img src="images/lbtxt05.png" width="500" height="39"
alt="Text of the note" longdesc="#text04" />
<span class="caption">[<a href="#text05">Go to text version</a>.]</span>
</div>

<p>and had evidently been prepared in anticipation of the rush
of patrons which it was almost certain would fairly besiege
the place before they were ready to receive them.</p>

<p>Once in the theatre, it was seen that Dickey and Mopsey
had not been wasting their time, for there was such a collection
of cast-off uniforms and weapons as would have furnished
a much larger company than theirs with outfits.
The two who had gathered this remarkable collection together
were standing over it in conscious pride; but Mopsey
did not give them much opportunity for admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now all hands turn to an&rsquo; git dressed,&rdquo; he said, in a tone
of authority, well knowing that his command would be willingly
obeyed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be sure to be ready, an&rsquo; we can
eat dinner after we&rsquo;re rigged up jest as well as not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it was only too evident that Mopsey would be obliged
to superintend the dressing of each boy, the party stood
waiting for him to designate the one who should receive the
first attention.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start on you, Dickey,&rdquo; said Mopsey; and some of
the party thought that while the two had been alone that
day, Master Spry had stipulated that he should have the
honor of being arrayed first.</p>

<p>Dickey stepped in front of the busy-looking manager, his
face beaming with delight, and his mouth open so wide that
his smile seemed almost a grin.</p>

<p>Among the collection out of which Shakespeare&rsquo;s characters
were to stalk into view were quite a number of Mrs.
Green&rsquo;s kitchen utensils, and nearly all of the party were
puzzled as to what was to be done with them when Dickey&rsquo;s
toilet explained everything. Two tin covers that had evidently
been taken from the wash-boilers were fastened on
Master Spry&rsquo;s chest and back, and Mopsey insisted on lashing
them on so strongly, lest they should become displaced
in the fight, that poor Dickey found it impossible to hang
his arms down by his side, but was obliged to hold them
straight out, very much to his discomfort. A tin saucepan,
somewhat the worse for wear, and well blackened, was placed
on his head for a helmet, and in his hands a huge cavalry
sabre. To throw a dash of color into what would otherwise
have been a rather sombre-looking costume, Mopsey laced a
quantity of red tape around each leg, which gave him a very
striking appearance, to say the least.</p>

<p>But every rose must have a thorn, and Dickey soon found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
out what particular thorn there was in wearing the costume
of Macbeth. In the first place, since he could not use his
arms sufficiently to bring them around in front of him, he
was obliged to dispense with a shield, for it would have
been worse than useless; and again, when he tried to sit
down, after he had been admired by his companions, he
found that the tin covers were so long that they doomed
him to stand until the close of the performance. He would
have liked a rest just then, for he was very tired, but the
exigencies of the case, and costume, prevented him, and he
leaned up in the corner, looking, save about the legs, like a
turtle in a restaurant window.</p>

<p>Johnny was the next one who was to be made happy, and
perhaps uncomfortable, by Mr. Dowd&rsquo;s idea of costume. But
his was on an entirely different scale, since he was to play the
part of Othello. A pair of blue uniform trousers were first
put on, and then pinned up, since they had originally been
intended for a man; a broad leather belt was buckled tightly
around his waist, and in this was placed a carving-knife, a
pistol with no lock and but part of the barrel, and a jack-knife;
an old sack of Mrs. Green&rsquo;s, made of red flannel and
somewhat soiled, was put on as coat, and on the shoulders
were pinned epaulets made of gilt paper. In addition to
the weapons contained in his belt, Johnny had a genuine
sword and scabbard fastened to his side, and an army musket
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
to carry in his hands, that looked as if it might have been
used in every battle during the late war.</p>

<p>It seemed singular that two should be condemned to
stand, and through no one&rsquo;s fault; but Johnny also found
it almost impossible to sit down, owing to the number of
pins Mopsey had used, to make sure that the trousers would
remain at the proper length, and he leaned against the wall
by the side of Dickey.</p>

<p>Ben&rsquo;s costume required very little care, since it was simply
a sheet thrown over his head; but he insisted so strongly
that a ghost had just as much right as anybody else to have
his legs laced up with red tape, and to wear a sword, that
Mopsey was obliged to give way, and do as he desired. A
profusion of tape was tied around his legs; and in order to
produce a pleasing effect in case his feet could be seen below
the sheet, he insisted on having quite a number of ends
hanging down from the ankles. He also had a belt, with a
carving-knife, and a pistol in about the same state of repair
that Johnny&rsquo;s was, stuck into it; and then, with the
sheet over his arm, so that he could have it handy, he looked
on while the others dressed, envied by Dickey and Johnny
because he could sit down so comfortably.</p>

<p>Paul made a very showy-looking Hamlet, to say the
least. He wore a pair of rubber boots many sizes too large
for him, with tops that reached his knees, and were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
ornamented with tissue-paper rosettes; a black frock-coat, which
on close inspection proved to be Johnny&rsquo;s best one, that
he had worn when he called upon Mrs. Green, hung about
his shoulders, covering his hands completely with its profusion
of sleeves, and giving him a singular, if not distinguished
appearance. This coat had been made more gorgeous
than it originally was by having gilt paper pasted to
each button, and a red sash tied about the waist, in which
were two table-forks and a wooden sword, the latter article
interfering sadly with his knees when he walked. On
his head he wore a huge paper cap that had been painted
red, white, and blue, and ornamented with a tuft of feathers
that had once done service in a dusting-brush. He
also had a gun, and the weight of it was about as much as
he could stagger under when he tried to carry it over his
shoulder, so he dragged it along behind him, very much as
a person of Hamlet&rsquo;s melancholy temperament would have
been likely to do. He also could sit down, which was no
small comfort.</p>

<p>All this costuming had taken some time, and Mrs. Green
had already called up the staircase that dinner was nearly
ready before Mopsey had commenced to clothe himself in
such garments as he supposed Richard the Third wore.
First he put on a thin pair of cotton pants that had once
been white, but were now a drab, and which fitted quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
closely to his skin. On the outside seams of these he pinned
a strip of gilt paper, and then drew on a pair of boots, the
tops of which came up quite as high on him as the rubber
ones did on Paul. Around these boots was laced more red
tape, until it would have been a difficult matter to have
formed any idea as to what they might have been intended
for originally. He had a broad leather belt, and outside of
it was a red sash, with ends that nearly touched the floor.
As weapons he wore a sword in a scabbard, a carving-knife,
a portion of a pistol, and a table-fork. His coat was a soldier&rsquo;s
overcoat, cut down to prevent it from trailing on the
floor when he walked, and on his head was a paper cap
nearly twice as large, and with very much more ornamentation
in the way of feathers and red paint than had the one
worn by Paul.</p>

<p>The company were now ready for their arduous duties on
the stage, and could afford the time to go to dinner. More
than once had Mrs. Green called out to them that that very
important meal was ready, and should be eaten if they expected
her to get the dishes washed in time to act as door-keeper.
She had also become imbued with the excitement
of this first performance, and had packed away her fruit-stand
fully two hours earlier than usual, in order that she
might first feed her actor-boarders, and then look out for
their interest at the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
It was a ferocious looking and, in at least two cases, an
uncomfortable feeling company that filed down the stairs
and into the dining-room, led by Dickey, who was obliged
to enter the door sideways, because his arms stuck out so
straight as to prevent his moving through any aperture less
than five feet wide in any other way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; ejaculated the startled landlady, as she saw
this singular-looking object enter the room, followed by
four others, more or less gorgeous, and all equally terrible.
&ldquo;How on earth did you contrive to make yourselves look
so horrible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mopsey did it,&rdquo; squeaked Dickey, piteously, as if he
had been accused of some wrong deed, and earnestly wishing
that he was the ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Macbeth,&rdquo; said Mopsey, in explanation, and anxious
to show that he had only done his duty in thus making
Dickey so uncomfortable. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty near the way
Macbeth always gits hisself up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; said Mrs. Green, sympathizingly, &ldquo;it must
have been terrible hard for him, an&rsquo; he couldn&rsquo;t had a great
deal of comfort with his arms.&rdquo; And then, as she looked
over her spectacles pityingly at the miniature Macbeth, and
noticed that it was the covers of her wash-boilers that he
wore, she said, &ldquo;You must be awful careful not to tumble
down, Dickey, for you never could get up; an&rsquo; besides, if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
anybody should step on you they&rsquo;d spoil them covers, an&rsquo;
one of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s &rsquo;most new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dickey made no promise, but his face showed plainly that
he appreciated the danger he would be in if he should fall
over, and that he was determined to stand as straight as possible
in the combat which would take place in the third act.</p>

<p>All of the company save Dickey and Johnny seated
themselves at the table, and began to make a hearty but
hurried meal. Johnny stood up in a careful manner, and
got along very well, but poor Dickey could neither sit
down nor help himself. He made one or two vain efforts
to pick up a biscuit from the table, but his armor would
not permit, and he was about to lean back against the wall
in helpless indignation, when Mrs. Green noticed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; she said, in a motherly tone, &ldquo;I do think
it is a shame for Mopsey to rig you up in such a way that
you can&rsquo;t eat, an&rsquo; you do have such a good appetite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted to play Macbeth,&rdquo; said Mopsey, anxious to
clear himself from any blame, &ldquo;an&rsquo; if he plays it he&rsquo;s got
to go that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wanted to play it,&rdquo; said Dickey, in a pathetic
tone that told he would never want to do such an uncomfortable
thing again. &ldquo;I wanted to, but I didn&rsquo;t know I
was goin&rsquo; to be fixed so&rsquo;s I couldn&rsquo;t even wiggle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Green went without her own supper for the sake
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
of giving Dickey his, and she fed him patiently, while he
stood with outstretched hands leaning against the wall, but
able to eat all that was put in his mouth.</p>

<p>By the time the boys were through supper Nelly came
into the room, dressed for her portion of the work in the
evening&rsquo;s performance; and even Mopsey, who the day before
had suggested that she should wear a sword, thought she
looked charming in her white dress with blue ribbons.</p>

<p>It was very near the time set for opening the doors, and
already they could hear a crowd of boys on the sidewalk,
as they jostled and pushed in their efforts to enter before
the managers were ready to receive them. Mopsey, excited
at this clamor of the public, drove his company up-stairs,
and hurried Mrs. Green to such an extent that she concluded
to let her house-work go until after the performance,
and went down to open the door.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter X.</span></h2>

<h3>THE FIRST ACT.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>he noble company of actors stood in breathless expectancy
behind the scenes of their theatre, waiting
for the sound of tramping feet that should tell
of the rush of the public to witness their genius,
as shown in this particular line of business. The interest
was so great that even Dickey forgot the discomfort of his
Macbeth costume, and stood as near a crevice in the boards
as possible, to see their patrons as they filed into the hall.</p>

<p>The auditorium was as near a scene of enchantment as
tallow-candles could make it. The twelve bottle foot-lights
flared and flickered as if they were conscious of the wonderful
display of talent they were there to illumine, while the
barrel-hoop chandeliers cast even a more brilliant light than
one would have supposed. The flower decorations on the
wall, forming the word that meant quite as much as if it
had been spelled correctly, stood forth in all their beauty,
even more prominently than if the light had been stronger.</p>

<p>That Mrs. Green had never acted in the capacity of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
door-keeper of a theatre before, was shown by the trouble she
was having. It had been her purpose to open the street-door,
and then go in advance of the crowd to the door of
the hall, where she could receive either the money or the
tickets of those who entered. But one look at the noisy
throng was sufficient to convince her that more than half of
them would distance her in the race up-stairs. She therefore
changed her plan, and by exerting all her strength
she was able to keep the door closed so far as to prevent
more than one from entering at a time. By this means she
succeeded in collecting tickets from nearly all who entered.
As soon as she thought she could do so with safety, she
ran up to the attic-door, where she could act the part of
door-keeper with more comfort and dignity.</p>

<p>At least fifteen minutes before the advertised time for
the performance to begin, every one of Dickey&rsquo;s board-seats
were filled with a noisy, perspiring crowd of boys, who
found considerable amusement in swaying back and forth on
the not very secure seats, until one of them would go down
with a crash. This seemed to afford the greatest amount
of amusement to those who were thus thrown to the floor.</p>

<p>Good Mrs. Green was thoroughly astonished by the
amount of patronage bestowed that night; for after she
thought that the audience was complete, boys of all sizes
continued to pour in, until she had quite a pile of five-cent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
pieces in her apron, besides the tickets, and nearly one-half
of those present were obliged to stand.</p>

<p>Although it was not eight o&rsquo;clock, the audience suddenly
came to the conclusion that it was time for the performance
to begin, and they announced that fact by piercing whistles,
furious stamping of the feet, and such gentle admonitions
to the managers as, &ldquo;Hurry up, Mopsey,&rdquo; &ldquo;Give it to us
now, Shiner,&rdquo; as well as other phrases betokening extreme
familiarity.</p>

<p>The managers of this theatre were not unmindful of the
fact that their audience must be obeyed, even if some of
the rules were broken, and Ben and Paul were ordered by
the author, who had taken upon himself the position of
sole manager, to raise the curtain. Then Nelly came out
and sang a melody that all were familiar with, being assisted
by the audience in the chorus, until Mrs. Green was
obliged to cover her ears with her hands, lest the great
volume of music should give her a headache.</p>

<p>This portion of the entertainment was greeted with the
wildest applause; and when Master Dowd, after Nelly had
left the stage, attempted to appear in all the gorgeousness
of his costume, he was plainly told to go back and let
Nelly sing again&mdash;a command which he obeyed at once,
lest some of his audience should take it into their heads
to force compliance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
After Nelly had sung the second time the applause died
away, as if the audience were willing that the regular business
of the evening should proceed. All the actors were
standing where they could go on to the stage at a moment&rsquo;s
notice, save Dickey, who was leaning against the wall, holding
his sword straight out, at the imminent peril of hitting
some one of his partners as they passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now be all ready, Dickey,&rdquo; said Mopsey, warningly,
as he prepared to go on the stage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; whispered Johnny, &ldquo;be kinder careful when
you an&rsquo; I fight, &rsquo;cause there&rsquo;s lots of pins in these pants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mopsey nodded his head, as much as to say that he would
look out for such things, and in another instant he was
before the foot-lights, receiving a storm of applause, although
he was at a loss to know whether it was directed
to him personally, or to the costume he wore. So great
was the enthusiasm manifested by his presence that it was
some moments before he could speak, and during that time
the few lines he knew of the part of Richard the Third
had entirely escaped his memory. It was a trying moment
both to him and his brother actors, who were watching
him, as he stood there with drawn sword, first on one
foot and then on the other, waving his hand and then the
weapon, as if he were about to speak, and yet making no
sound.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
&ldquo;Go on, Mopsey&mdash;say something,&rdquo; whispered Ben in a
hoarse voice; and the audience hearing him, suggested
kindly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, give us somethin&rsquo;, old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus urged, Mopsey made one mighty effort, and shouted
in his loudest tones, as he waved the sword still more
frantically than ever,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my hoss! I&rsquo;ve lost my hoss, an&rsquo; I want some
one to tie up my head&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;but I&rsquo;m a match for
any feller &rsquo;round here, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not only evident to the audience, but to Mopsey
himself, that it was of no use for him to try to remember
the words he should have spoken, and he waved his sword
frantically for Johnny to come on, hoping to save his good
name by the bloody combat, which could be prolonged
until their patrons were in good-humor. But just at this
moment it was impossible for Johnny to be of any service.
He had tried to alter the position of some of the pins in
his trousers, so that they would not prick him so badly,
and the consequence was that the entire work was undone,
while one leg fell down over his foot in a manner that prevented
him from stepping, unless at the risk of tumbling
flat on his face. Ben did his best to repair the damage,
while Mopsey stood waving his sword, whispering very
audibly for Johnny not to mind the pins but to come on.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
Meantime the audience, in the loudest tones, coaxed Johnny
to come out and take Mopsey away.</p>

<p>But Ben succeeded finally in getting the ill-costumed
Othello arranged so that it was possible for him to walk,
and he rushed on to the stage, the gun in one hand and
the sword in the other, just as Mopsey was meditating a
retreat from the freely-expressed criticism of his audience.</p>

<p>The relief of the author-actor when he saw Othello was
greater than could be expressed by words, and he resolved
to regain the good opinion of the audience by the ferocity
with which he would wage the combat. It is probable that
some such thought was expressed in his face when he rushed
towards Johnny, for, startled by the furious bearing of his
partner, Othello became frightened, and holding both weapons
in front of him, he looked ready for instant flight.
It seemed as if this very timidity restored to the prototype
of the cruel Richard all his assurance, for now, suddenly
remembering the words he should have spoken at
Johnny&rsquo;s first appearance, he waved his sword still more
furiously, and shouted,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks as if there was more than a dozen of this same
feller, for I&rsquo;ve killed four or five already, an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s a lot
more of him.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">HOLDING BOTH WEAPONS IN FRONT OF HIM, HE LOOKED READY FOR INSTANT FLIGHT.</span>
</div>

<p>Johnny was a trifle alarmed at the words, and looked almost
timidly behind him to see if he was really there in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
several forms, or if it was only a portion of the play, when
Mopsey struck his gun so severe a blow with the edge of his
sword that it fell from his not over-strong grasp, striking
directly on the toes of the blood-thirsty Richard.</p>

<p>There was a howl of pain as Mopsey dropped his sword
with a clang, and appeared trying to gather his feet into his
arms, where he could nurse them, while this shock of weapons
on the frail stage caused such a motion of the foot-lights
that two of them fell to the floor, smashing the bottles.
The audience in the reserved seats, anxious to prevent
any disturbance of the performance, scrambled for the candles,
and the two who succeeded in getting them before
they were extinguished kindly held them in their hands
during the remainder of the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know enough to fight when the time comes?&rdquo;
cried Mopsey, who, having given up the useless task of nursing
his bruised feet, picked up his sword again and advanced
once more upon the timid Othello, who was trying
to decide whether he should remain there or run away.</p>

<p>These words had the effect of spurring Johnny on to a
more perfect acting of his part, more especially since some
of his friends in the audience cried out, in a friendly way,
&ldquo;Go for him, Shiner, an&rsquo; give him fits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Johnny did &ldquo;go for&rdquo; his adversary almost too
strongly, for he refused to die as Mopsey had told him he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
must, but continued to strike out wildly with his sword,
hitting Mopsey&rsquo;s weapon a portion of the time, and when he
failed in that, coming so near Richard&rsquo;s face that it seemed
certain he would slice off one of his ears or his nose.</p>

<p>It was a furious combat, truly, and the audience favored
it with the most generous applause, some inciting Mopsey
and others Johnny to renewed exertions, until Mrs. Green
started up in alarm, fearing that a riot would ensue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you die?&rdquo; whispered Mopsey, hoarsely, as
he panted from exertion, and believed that in justice to the
other performers the battle should end.</p>

<p>But Johnny refused positively to die, and it is probable
that he would have continued the fight as long as he had
strength or breath left, had he not been the victim of his
own architectural shortcomings. He, the one who had built
the stage, actually forgot the pitfalls in the form of spaces
left uncovered because of lack of lumber; and in the excitement
and fury of the battle, minding only the shouts of
encouragement from the audience, he fell into one of these
yawning pits, and Richard had a chance to become himself
once more. With head down and heels up, the unfortunate
Othello struggled in the prisoning space until every one of
the bottle foot-lights had been displaced, and an even dozen
of the audience seated themselves on the floor, holding the
candles in their hands obligingly. Ben had taken Dickey
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
from his leaning-place against the wall, and brought him to
the side from which he was to make his entrance when
Richard and Othello had first begun to fight, so that when
Johnny fell he rushed on in a sidelong way, in order to
present his sword-arm to the conqueror.</p>

<p>King Richard was so entirely exhausted from his long
struggle that he had apparently forgotten the course he had
marked out for the rest of his company, and was leaning on
his sword, gazing at the supposed-to-be-dead Othello, wondering
whether he ought to help him to rise or not, when
Ben launched Dickey full at him. He had no time to parry
the shock, nor Macbeth to check the force with which
Ben had sent him, and the consequence was that Richard
and Macbeth fell almost directly on top of the struggling
Othello with a thud that threatened to rend asunder each
particular board of the frail stage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green uttered a cry of horror as she realized that
the cover of her new wash-boiler must have been injured;
but that noise, as well as the terrified squeak from Othello,
was drowned in the burst of applause that came from the
spectators. Mopsey sprang to his feet as quickly as possible,
bowing his acknowledgments to the audience as if he
had planned the scene, while poor Dickey lay prone upon
the almost suffocated Johnny, unable to rise, or even to
move so that Othello might extricate himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
As the audience continued to applaud, Mopsey felt that
he was forced to remain before them, bowing, and almost
expecting to be deluged with bouquets, and, of course, he
was not aware that two members of his company needed
his immediate assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help Dickey! Why don&rsquo;t you help Dickey?&rdquo; whispered
Ben from the wings, thinking that it would not be
seemly in the ghost of Hamlet&rsquo;s father to rush on to the
stage before his time. But King Richard paid no attention
to this call, if indeed he heard it, and, after waiting
some moments, Ben, with his ghostly covering still flung
over his arm, was obliged to go to the assistance of the two
warriors, thereby causing a fresh burst of applause. He
rolled Dickey over and over until Paul could drag him off
by the shoulders, and then pulling Johnny out by the feet,
he aided him in repairing the damages done to his costume
by his descent through the stage.</p>

<p>It was now time that the dead Othello should do his song
and dance, and in a very audible whisper he informed Mopsey
that he had better get off, and give him the chance.
Some of the audience suggested the same thing, and very
reluctantly Mopsey left the stage, while Johnny concluded
the act in a highly successful manner by a dance that was
considerably better executed than was his sword-play.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XI.</span></h2>

<h3>THE EVENING&rsquo;S ENTERTAINMENT.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcaps"><span class="dropcap">S</span></span>urely if noise was any proof that the audience
was satisfied with the performance given by Mopsey&rsquo;s
company, then all must have been highly delighted,
for such confusion was probably never heard
in that house before as when the curtain fell on the first
act of this new edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays. The actors
were in a perfect whirl of delight, and all save Dickey showed
it by dancing and shaking hands, until there was almost as
much confusion behind the curtain as in front.</p>

<p>Mopsey was so delighted at the success that his gigantic
brain conceived a startling idea for the entrance of the
ghost, which was neither more nor less than for Ben to
crouch under the stage, in the very hole where Johnny had
come to grief, and at the proper time to rise up in a ghostly
fashion, which must surely be very effective. Ben was disposed
to object to this hiding under the flooring, more
especially since he would be enveloped in the sheet, and
would doubtless be uncomfortably warm; but all his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
objections were overruled by the author and company, and he
gave a very unwilling assent to the proposition.</p>

<p>In order that the audience might not be kept waiting
until their patience was exhausted, or their good-humor
began to evaporate, the curtain was raised as soon as the
ghost could be tucked away in his hiding-place, and Paul
made his first appearance on any stage. Mopsey had explained
to him the part which he was to assume, and in a
well-thumbed copy of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works belonging to Mrs.
Green he had found the lines which Hamlet is supposed to
speak after he sees the ghost. These he had committed to
memory, although he had little idea of the meaning of them;
and when he came upon the stage he addressed the audience
as if in them he saw the ghost of his murdered father.</p>

<p>Now Ben had seen the play of &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; several times, and
he knew enough about it to know that the speech Paul was
delivering should be addressed to him. In his anxiety to
have the scene played properly, he marred the effect of his
own entrance somewhat by popping his head out of the hole
and whispering, hoarsely,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn &rsquo;round this way, Polly; turn &rsquo;round to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul heard the advice, and he turned his back to the
audience. Ben, seeing that his suggestion had been carried
out, ducked his head again, very much to Hamlet&rsquo;s perplexity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
Mopsey had stated particularly that as soon as he saw the
ghost he must run away in alarm, and yet Ben would persist
in keeping out of sight even though he had attracted
his attention.</p>

<p>Paul repeated all of the speech he had committed to
memory, and then waited for the ghostly visitant. Ben,
who had not anticipated that there was so much speaking
in Hamlet&rsquo;s part, was rather confused, and did not know
whether it was time for him to come out and strike terror
to the heart of his supposed son or not.</p>

<p>He popped out his head two or three times, but Paul was
not standing in such a position as he fancied would be best
suited for the reception of a ghost, and he went back again
out of sight, delighting the audience with his agility, and
confusing Hamlet.</p>

<p>Paul knew that it was not the proper thing for him to
stand there silent, and, fearing lest he might not have said
enough, he began to repeat the same speech over again.</p>

<p>Ben realized that it was but a repetition that doomed him
still to remain in hiding, and believing it to be a mistake on
Paul&rsquo;s part, he whispered, loudly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said that before; say something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul was perfectly well aware that he had repeated those
words before, and he was doing so for the very good reason
that he did not know what else to say; but the ghost&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
command confused him, and he stood silent and motionless,
resolved to remain quiet rather than make a mistake.</p>

<p>By this time Mopsey had discovered that there was something
the matter with the two actors who were supposed
to be delighting the audience, and he found that it was the
ghost who was delaying the progress of the play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out of there, Ben,&rdquo; he whispered, loudly; and
some of the audience hearing him, they called, in pleasant
tones,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, come out, Ben, and show yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus urged, the ghost could do no less than make his
appearance, and he arose from his place of partial concealment
as majestically as he could, considering the fact that
the sheet had been caught upon a nail, and he was obliged
to stoop two or three times to unfasten it. But he did
succeed in rising at last, and then, to make himself look
as much like a spectre as possible, he held both arms
straight out as he walked slowly down the stage.</p>

<p>It is very likely that he would have made a good impression
if it had not been for that portion of his costume
that did not properly belong to the character he was assuming.
The long ends of tape that he had insisted on
allowing to hang down from his ankles persisted in getting
under his feet, and he tripped himself up with a force that
gave Hamlet a genuine fright. The sheet which covered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
Ben&rsquo;s head prevented him from rising as quickly as he
would have liked, and while he was trying to disengage
himself from it, Paul, realizing that he should run away,
did so by leaping over the prostrate ghost, to the great
delight of the patrons.</p>

<p>The shock of Ben&rsquo;s fall and Paul&rsquo;s leap so shook the
frail structure which Johnny had built that the curtain
came down with a thud, tearing away from its fastenings
above, and the poor ghost was made doubly a prisoner by
this additional covering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tear it, Ben!&rdquo; shouted Johnny, fearing lest his
artistic labors in the way of the &ldquo;Wild Indian&rdquo; would be
ruined, and then he and Mopsey sprang on the stage, rescuing
the curtain from the frantic clutch of the ghost, and
leaving that worthy to get to his feet as best he might.</p>

<p>Of course the audience enjoyed all this highly; and
while they hooted and shrieked in the excess of their delight,
Ben succeeded in escaping from the rather awkward
mantle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can dance, if I don&rsquo;t do the ghost very well!&rdquo; he
shouted, almost angrily, to the noisy audience; and then he
began to prove the truth of his words with a force that
threatened the immediate destruction of the entire theatrical
surroundings.</p>

<p>And the audience seemed to realize that Ben could dance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
for they insisted on his continuing that portion of his duties
until he was bathed in perspiration, and so tired that he
could hardly move.</p>

<p>Of course, now that the curtain had been wrecked, there
was no opportunity for dividing the acts, and after the
applause which Ben&rsquo;s efforts had produced died away,
Mopsey sent Nelly on to sing again. The audience greeted
her kindly, as before, and not only insisted on joining in
the chorus, but demanded more than she had intended to
give. They were evidently determined to get the full value
of their money, and, suspecting that she would appear no
more that evening, dictated to her such songs as they wanted
to hear.</p>

<p>It was of no use for her to refuse, for they insisted upon
their demands being complied with so noisily that the performance
could not proceed until they were ready. She
stood there singing until she was hoarse, while the entire
company waited, in battle-array, for the time to come
when they should make their last appearance in the great
combat.</p>

<p>It was nearly half an hour before Nelly was allowed to
go; and as soon as she was clear of the stage the waiting
forces rushed on, displaying the most wonderful skill with
their swords.</p>

<p>It would not be exactly correct to say that all of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
company rushed on, for Dickey made his appearance very
carefully. Of course he was obliged to come sideways,
and he moved with great caution, lest he should fall down
again, thus working more damage to the covers of Mrs.
Green&rsquo;s wash-boilers. But he got on with the others, even
if he was slower in his movements, and soon was in the
very midst of the mimic battle, apparently the most wounded
one there, judging from the blows that were rained upon
his armor.</p>

<p>The combatants had soon found out that their stage was
hardly large enough for the movements of an army of five
with such long swords, and that the greatest caution must
be used to prevent serious injury to some of them. Therefore,
when Mopsey hit a resounding blow on the front-piece
of Dickey&rsquo;s armor with the back of his sword, all
saw that the din of battle could be represented in that way
much better and with less danger than by clashing their
swords together.</p>

<p>And thus it happened that poor Dickey found himself
in the midst of a blood-thirsty crowd, each one pounding
him on the chest or back, while he was unable to parry
the attack, save when some one incautiously moved towards
his sword-arm. He cried for mercy at the full force of his
lungs, while Mrs. Green shouted the same request because
of her tin-ware. The audience were equally divided in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
opinion as to whether Macbeth had been punished enough,
and still the blows were delivered with such force and
noise that one would have thought an army of tinsmiths
were at work.</p>

<p>How long this unequal combat might have gone on it
is impossible to say; for when Dickey found that he was
likely to have no mercy shown him so long as the audience
was so well pleased, he dropped to his knees, and then
tried to roll off the stage. Of course, he could roll over
no more easily than a turtle, but he had stopped the supposed
sanguinary fight, and he was satisfied. Having no
one on whom they could wreak their vengeance without
considerable danger to themselves, the combatants dispersed,
and not until then did Mopsey remember that the
very one whom they had been using so roughly was the
one upon whom they depended to close the performance.</p>

<p>When the self-elected manager thought of this, he called
to Ben to help him set the vanquished Macbeth on his
feet, and to get him in dancing condition. It was quite an
easy matter to get the tin-encased hero on his feet, but quite
another matter to bolster him up so that he could dance.
Dickey was wearied with long standing, sore from the effects
of the pounding, and so thoroughly cured of his desire
to wear an armor, that all he thought of or wanted was to
get where he could take off the trappings of war, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
become a humble boot-blacking citizen once more. In fact
he utterly refused to dance, which would really have been
an impossibility, unless he had been relieved from the embarrassment
of the boiler covers, and Ben and Johnny went
on in a double clog to give a proper finish to the performance.</p>

<span class="caption">DICKEY FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF A BLOOD-THIRSTY CROWD.</span>
</div>

<p>Inasmuch as there was no curtain, it was found necessary
for Mopsey to go forward and announce that the evening&rsquo;s
entertainment was finished&mdash;an announcement which the
audience was not inclined to accept as a fact. They utterly
refused to leave their seats, and it was not until Nelly
had appeared and sung three more songs that they left the
theatre. Then, although they drew some comparisons between
that theatre and others which they had attended,
which were certainly not very favorable to Mopsey, they
departed, apparently very well satisfied that they had received
the full worth of their money.</p>

<p>The entertainment had lasted fully two hours, and every
one of the performers, but more especially Dickey, was
greatly pleased when the last one of the audience passed
out of the door. It would be stating it all too mildly to
say that Mrs. Green was relieved when they had gone.
The good woman had been in a deplorable condition of
fear since the time the first hearty applause was raised,
and she had been seriously afraid that they would go through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
the floor of her attic in some of their more vigorous manifestations
of pleasure.</p>

<p>Before the last one of their patrons had left the hall
Dickey had asked Paul to help him cast aside the uncomfortable
costume of Macbeth. When that was done, Master
Spry stated most emphatically that if he ever acted again
it would be in some part where the use of armor was entirely
forbidden.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, the first thing the partners were
anxious about, after their patrons had departed, was to know
how large their profits were from that evening&rsquo;s excessive
labor. Without waiting to change their costumes, save
as has been related in the case of Dickey, they gathered
around Mrs. Green, who was beginning to recover some of
the senses that had been frightened from her. She and
Paul counted the money she had in her apron, and the
amount was found to be three dollars and five cents.
There was already in Treasurer Paul&rsquo;s hands eight dollars
and sixty cents, and when it was announced that the evening&rsquo;s
performance had netted them the very handsome
amount of eleven dollars and sixty-five cents, the joy of
the partners showed itself in many extravagant ways.</p>

<p>Ben proposed, and the boys agreed to it willingly, that
one dollar of that amount be paid to Mrs. Green for the
use of the attic. This being so much more than she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
expected, caused her to look upon the theatrical enterprise
as a gigantic success.</p>

<p>Then quite a discussion arose as to what should be done
with the funds on hand. Mopsey was in favor of making
an immediate division; but such a plan was thought by
the others to be most unwise. Dickey proposed that a
certain sum be set aside as working capital, and the balance
divided among them all, including Nelly, of course, since
she had contributed in no slight degree to the success of
the entertainment.</p>

<p>This appeared satisfactory to the majority of the party,
and would probably have been done if Ben, who had taken
no part in the discussion, but appeared to be thinking deeply
of something, had not said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan that I reckon you&rsquo;ll all agree to; but
I don&rsquo;t want to tell what it is yet awhile. Now I say, let&rsquo;s
let Paul keep it till Monday night; it won&rsquo;t spoil if we
don&rsquo;t divide it till then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since there was no good reason why this request should
not be granted, and since Ben seemed so anxious to have it
left that way, the rest of the partners agreed quite willingly.
Then the tired company of actors crept off to bed,
proud in the belief that their venture had been a success,
but anxious to rest.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XII.</span></h2>

<h3>A GENEROUS ACT.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapo"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>n Monday morning before they parted, and while
Dickey was still their guest, Ben was very mysterious
in his actions. He avoided Paul so much that
one would have said he suspected the treasurer of
having embezzled some of the funds of the concern.</p>

<p>But if any one knowing him had suspected that such was
the case, that supposition would have been rejected as soon
as a full view had been had of his face. He appeared to be
in the most perfect good-humor, but considerably excited.
Before he left the house he had succeeded in whispering
these same words to Mopsey, Dickey, and Johnny, without
having been overheard by Paul:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meet me at Nelly&rsquo;s stand &rsquo;bout &rsquo;leven o&rsquo;clock, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
let Polly know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only one of that party who had not been in the best
of spirits during the Sabbath, when Mrs. Green had exacted
a due observance of the day by her boarders, was Paul, and
he had been very sad. It was the second Sunday that had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
passed since he had been so unfortunately separated from
his parents, and his distress of mind seemed to have increased,
instead of being soothed, by time; in fact, as the
days passed on, and he still found himself very far from accomplishing
his purpose, he began to despair of ever succeeding.</p>

<p>As successful as they had been with their theatrical enterprise,
the proceeds were not as large as he had expected;
and when he figured out the amount which was each one&rsquo;s
share, he realized that it would be very long before he
could get from that source money enough to buy his ticket
home.</p>

<p>A few days previous to the giving of the entertainment,
he had asked at one of the numerous ticket-offices on Broadway
how much they would sell him a ticket for, and had
been told that he could go for half fare, which would be
fourteen dollars&mdash;a sum of money which seemed almost a
fortune to him. During that day Ben had talked with him
about his chances of getting home, what he would do when
he got there, and many questions about his relatives, all of
which Paul had answered readily, although it added to his
distress to speak of such matters.</p>

<p>When Monday came, and the boys started out to attend
to their business duties, Paul noticed that there was an evident
anxiety on the part of all his companions to avoid him.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
This pained him more than he would have been willing to
admit, and it was with a heavy heart that he went about his
work, wondering what he had done to cause any change in
their feelings towards him.</p>

<p>As all of that theatrical company had expected, they
heard many criticisms on the performance they had given,
and it seemed as though all of their patrons bestowed more
time on giving them advice for future guidance than on
their regular business. Some advised that Saturday evening
performances be given each week, assuring the firm of
their support during the entire season. Others were so unkind
as to advise that a small theatre be built for Mopsey,
where he could take all the parts himself, and very many
had suggestions to give Dickey as to the kind of armor he
should wear the next time he played the part of Macbeth.</p>

<p>Some of this advice Dickey received in a kindly spirit, assuring
his friends of his determination never to play a part
again that required any such uncomfortable costume; but
to others he displayed considerable ill-feeling, and was so
unwise as to be angry, when he should have remembered
that as the public&rsquo;s servant, in the capacity of an actor, he
was obliged to hear their criticisms. But the partners were
made happy by knowing that, in the majority of individual
cases they heard of, their performance had given satisfaction,
and that if they could only get a new play, since they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
had exhausted all of Shakespeare&rsquo;s in one evening, they
might feel assured of considerable patronage again.</p>

<p>Having been told of this at an early hour in the morning,
Mopsey set about the task of writing, or thinking of,
another play immediately; and it was said by those who
watched him closely that he drove away at least four customers
that forenoon by his seeming discourtesy, while he
was trying to decide how a new play could be arranged.</p>

<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock, agreeably to the appointment made by
Ben, all the partners, except Paul, met at Mrs. Green&rsquo;s fruit-stand,
wondering not a little as to why they had been summoned.
Ben was there, almost bursting with importance;
and when he found that all, including Mrs. Green and Nelly,
were ready to listen to him, he said, as if he were again
on the stage:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a big plan, an&rsquo; I hope you&rsquo;ll all think jest the
same about it that I do. You know how bad Polly feels
&rsquo;cause he can&rsquo;t git back to his folks, for you see how he
moped round yesterday when we was all feelin&rsquo; so good.
Now, I jest come from a place where they sell railroad tickets,
an&rsquo; I found out that a little feller like him can get to
Chicager for fourteen dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long before he gets that much, if nothin&rsquo;
happens to the theatre,&rdquo; said Mopsey, much as if he had
been speaking of a gold-mine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
&ldquo;Not long!&rdquo; echoed Ben, almost contemptuously; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll
take him longer than you think for if he depends on that.
I asked him yesterday to figger up an&rsquo; see how much every
one would have after payin&rsquo; Mother Green, an&rsquo; he made it
a dollar&rsquo;n seventy cents. Now that&rsquo;s a healthy pile ter go
to Chicager on, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how can he fix it any other way?&rdquo; asked Dickey,
in considerable surprise, not understanding what Ben was
trying to get at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how we can. We can all turn to, Mother
Green an&rsquo; all, an&rsquo; give him the whole of the money. Then
he won&rsquo;t have to git only a little over two dollars to fix him
right, an&rsquo; I reckon me an&rsquo; Johnny can fix him out on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The partners looked at each other in surprise as this
startling proposition of Ben&rsquo;s was understood by them. For
some moments no one spoke, and then Dickey said, as if
his mind was made up so firmly that it would be impossible
for any one to try to change it,</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can have my share, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;gree to put in enough
more to make up as much as he&rsquo;s got to have jest as soon
as I kin earn it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Dickey,&rdquo; said Nelly, admiringly, knowing
that the ruined merchant&rsquo;s offer meant a great deal,
coming at a time when he was almost penniless. &ldquo;Mother
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll put in our share, won&rsquo;t we, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
&ldquo;Indeed we will,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Green; and before she
could say any more Johnny spoke up,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m in for anything Ben is, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s my
partner, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m mighty glad he thought of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mopsey was the only one who appeared to be at all
averse to the generous deed, and there seemed to be a great
struggle going on in his mind, when he should have been
the first to agree to it, since he had more money than all
the others save Mrs. Green.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shame on you, Mopsey, for not speaking right up, and
saying that you&rsquo;ll do as much as the others will,&rdquo; cried
Nelly, in great excitement, lest one of the party should
frustrate the others in their good work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give a feller a chance to say what he&rsquo;ll
do?&rdquo; replied Mopsey, angry with himself for having hesitated
at such a time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; to come in with the
rest, only I want to think it over first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll agree to it, will you?&rdquo; asked Ben, anxious
for the success of his plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will; didn&rsquo;t I say so?&rdquo; asked the pea-nut
merchant, sulkily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Ben, joyfully; &ldquo;an&rsquo; now let&rsquo;s
get what money he&rsquo;s got of ours, in some way so&rsquo;s he
won&rsquo;t know what we want it for, an&rsquo; add enough to it
so&rsquo;s to buy the ticket, an&rsquo; give it to him to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
The others, with the possible exception of Mopsey, were
eager to complete the good work at once and Mrs. Green
was called upon to tell them how much money was needed,
and how much each person would be obliged to give.
She was not an adept in the art of arithmetic, but after
some little time, during which a good many figures were
made, she informed them that the total amount needed was
two dollars and thirty-five cents, and that as there were
six of them, including herself and Nelly, each one would
be obliged to give a fraction over thirty-nine cents.</p>

<p>Ben responded at once with forty cents, although he
then had but ten cents left, and in a few moments the entire
sum was contributed. It was only necessary to get the
money which Paul had, and the ticket could be purchased.</p>

<p>It was decided that, since Ben had formed the plan, he
should carry it out&mdash;a task which he was perfectly willing
to perform; and, after promising to let his partners know
as soon as he had succeeded, he started off, happy at the
thought of being able to give Paul so much pleasure.
When he met the boy whom he was eager to make happy
once more, he had not been able to form any plan for getting
the theatrical funds from him without running the
risk of raising his suspicions. But since there was no other
course which he could pursue, he said, as innocently as
possible,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talkin&rsquo; with the other fellers, Paul, an&rsquo; I
want you to let me have the money that come from the
theatre. We&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; of doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; with it, an&rsquo;
when you come home to-night we&rsquo;ll tell you what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul had been thinking so much of his home and of
his parents, whom he feared he should not see again, that
he could have had no idea of Ben&rsquo;s purpose, even though
he had spoken more plainly, and he handed him the money
without a word.</p>

<p>During the remainder of that day Paul was considerably
mystified at the singular behavior of his friends; they indulged
in the most wonderful winks and nods to one another
whenever they were where he was, and something which
Ben showed them from time to time seemed to please them
immensely. Whenever he asked the reason for their unusual
good-humor, and apparent secrecy about something,
he was told that he should know at dinner-time, but not
before.</p>

<p>Without having the slightest suspicion as to what his
friends had done for him, Paul was so excited by the evident
secret which was being kept from him that he was
very impatient for the time to come when he could know
what it was.</p>

<p>Never before had the boys seemed so anxious to be with
him as they were during that afternoon, and he quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
forgot their seeming coolness of the morning. One or all of
them&mdash;excepting Mopsey, of course, who was obliged to
remain at his stand in the absence of the boy who sometimes
acted as clerk for him&mdash;kept near Paul all the day;
and when it was time to go to dinner, it seemed as if they
were escorting him home.</p>

<p>Once or twice while they were eating dinner some one
of the party had said, &ldquo;Now, Ben, now!&rdquo; but Ben had
shaken his head significantly and continued eating, as if
he had no other duty before him.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, instead of getting up from
the table as they were in the habit of doing, each one
of Mrs. Green&rsquo;s boarders, as well as herself and Nelly, remained
at the table as if waiting for something, and Paul
looked at them in the greatest surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mister Weston,&rdquo; said Ben, gravely, as he pushed his
plate farther on the table, and arose from his seat as if he
had a long speech to deliver, &ldquo;us fellers have seen that you
wasn&rsquo;t feelin&rsquo; very nice at havin&rsquo; to stay with us, an&rsquo; we
kinder thought you wanted to leave us &rsquo;cause things didn&rsquo;t
go to suit you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he paused for a moment, Paul, who had been in a perfect
maze of wonder at this preface to the speech, said,
quickly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure things go to please me as much as you can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
make them; but you mustn&rsquo;t feel angry if I don&rsquo;t want to
stay, &rsquo;cause you know just how it happened that I came
here; an&rsquo; when I think of my father an&rsquo; mother an&rsquo; my sister,
I can&rsquo;t&mdash;help&mdash;feeling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;MISTER WESTON,&rdquo; SAID BEN, GRAVELY.</span>
</div>

<p>Here Paul burst into a flood of tears at the thought that
his companions were reproving him for grieving for those
whom he loved so dearly, and whom he feared he might
never meet again. Ben hesitated at this grief of his friend,
and for a moment it seemed as if he could not continue until
he had tried to console him; but like one who has a
duty to perform, and must do it as quickly as possible, he
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t layin&rsquo; anything up agin you &rsquo;cause you don&rsquo;t
want to stay round here, for we don&rsquo;t blame you, seeing
how you&rsquo;ve got a good home to go to; an&rsquo; if we had one we
should tear round worse&rsquo;n you do. But all the same, we&rsquo;ve
seen how you felt about it, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve come to the &rsquo;clusion
that you&rsquo;d better not stay here any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul looked up in fear and surprise, for it certainly
seemed as if he was being turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; continued Ben, in a loud voice, growing more
emphatic the nearer he approached the conclusion of his
speech&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve made up our minds that you&rsquo;ve got to go,
an&rsquo; Dickey here&rsquo;s all ready to take your place as one of the
boarders. We give a pretty good show Saturday night, an&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
we got so much money out of it that we&rsquo;ve bought this for
you so&rsquo;s you can go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben handed Paul the ticket, which he had opened to full
length as he ceased speaking, and it was some moments before
the surprised boy could understand it all. But when
he realized that now he could go to his friends, if not to his
parents, his joy was more than he could control, and from
its very excess came the tears in an irresistible torrent.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XIII.</span></h2>

<h3>A JOYFUL MEETING.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>t is highly probable that one might have searched
over New York City that night and not found a
happier household than that of Mrs. Green&rsquo;s. Paul
was so wonderfully happy in the thought that he
was going back to Chicago, where, even though he could
not see his parents, he should find relatives and friends, that
he could talk of little else. Even the theatre was forgotten
by him; for when Mopsey spoke of the necessity of getting
another boy to take his place in the dramatic company he
hardly gave the matter a thought, except to say that he
hoped they would make plenty of money out of it. And
Paul&rsquo;s partners were happy, more happy than they could
possibly have been by any other outlay of their money;
Paul&rsquo;s pleasure reflected on them to such a degree that they
became almost as much excited as he was before the evening
was over.</p>

<p>Good Mrs. Green alternately laughed and cried, until she
seemed to realize that such nervousness was not exactly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
suitable to the occasion, and then she busied herself by reading
one of the papers Ben had brought home.</p>

<p>Master Treat had spent so much time on the good work
he had carried through so successfully, and then had paid so
much more attention to the boy he was going to surprise
than to the sale of his goods, that, instead of helping Johnny
as had been his purpose when he took some of his papers
to sell, he was a drawback, and the consequence was that
Mrs. Green had three evening papers to read, while Messrs.
Jones and Treat had been &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; just that number.</p>

<p>After she had joined in the general good time over Paul&rsquo;s
good-fortune with her daughter and her boarders, and
found that she was marring rather than adding to it by her
nervousness, she ceased to pay any more attention to what
was said by those about her, but became interested in the
advertisements of fruit for sale. Suddenly she came across
something that seemed to surprise her greatly, for she took
off her glasses and wiped them, as though she mistrusted
that which she saw was on the glass and not in the paper.</p>

<p>After satisfying herself that she was not the victim of an
optical delusion, her face was a remarkable sight, exhibiting
as it did surprise and delight alternately. It appeared as if
it was difficult for her to speak, for she tried several times
before she succeeded in saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to me every one of you, an&rsquo; if I ain&rsquo;t mistaken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
Paul will be more glad to hear this than he was to get his
ticket. This is what it says in this paper, word for word:
&lsquo;Paul Weston&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s in big letters. &lsquo;Any one who can
give information of Paul Weston, who strayed from an outward-bound
steamer on the afternoon of the seventeenth, will
receive a handsome reward by calling on the undersigned.
Said boy is ten years old, has light hair, blue eyes, nose
slightly turned up, and at the time of his disappearance was
dressed in dark blue clothes; he would most likely be trying
to make his way to Chicago, and any one who has seen
such a boy will please communicate at once with Rufus
Weston, Fifth Avenue Hotel.&rsquo; There! what do you think
of that?&rdquo; and Mrs. Green looked around at her circle of
listeners, who appeared to have been stricken dumb with
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that means me!&rdquo; exclaimed Paul, suddenly, as if
he had thought some one else was spoken of. &ldquo;And Rufus
Weston, that&rsquo;s my father! He didn&rsquo;t go away, after all.
And now, somebody, tell me where that hotel is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke he had grasped his coat and hat, running
from the house at full speed before he even knew which
direction he should take. There were none of that party
who had a very clear idea of what they were saying or
doing just then; but as the most important thing in their
minds was to see this father of Paul&rsquo;s, who had come at a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
time when his son was about to go home without his assistance,
each one of the boys started out in the same rapid
way, overtaking their more excited companion just as he
was stopping to consider which direction he should take.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way, Polly!&rdquo; shouted Ben, waving his hand, and
started along as if he were going to a fire.</p>

<p>No one thought of walking, for it seemed as if every
moment was precious then, and that they might not find
him if they were two or three minutes late. On they ran,
at full speed; and when they stood in a row before the
clerk of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, they were so breathless
that they could not speak distinctly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polly&rsquo;s come to see his father,&rdquo; said Ben, after they
had stood there so long that the clerk was about to order
one of the porters to turn this quite dirty and very ragged
crowd, who appeared to have come there simply to look at
him, out-of-doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is his father?&rdquo; asked the man, hardly believing
that any guest in that hotel would claim a son from that
rather disreputable-looking party, for Paul looked almost
as dirty and ragged as the others did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Rufus Weston,&rdquo; said Paul, speaking in a
low voice, because of the tears that would persist in coming
into his eyes, so much afraid was he that his father was no
longer there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>
<img src="images/lbtdn14.jpg" width="600" height="518" alt="" />
<span class="caption">THEY STOOD IN A ROW BEFORE THE CLERK OF THE FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
Almost every one in the hotel knew Mr. Weston&rsquo;s story,
and no sooner did he hear the name than the clerk, calling
one of the servants, ordered him to show this odd-looking
party to Mr. Weston&rsquo;s room. Paul almost ran ahead of
the man in his eagerness to see his father, while the others
were inclined to remain quite a distance in the rear, awed
by the elegant things they saw around them, and not quite
certain as to whether they ought to follow their friend.
When, finally, the man stopped before one of the doors,
knocked, and Paul rushed into the room, the boys heard a
scream of delight, and then they were shut out, as if their
companion had forgotten them entirely.</p>

<p>Ranged close to the wall, opposite the door which Paul
had entered, wondering whether they ought to go or stay,
four boys stood in bewilderment, hardly daring to speak.
Porters, servants, and guests passed them with looks of
wonder at the motionless line, who appeared to be trying
to make themselves as small as possible, so that they should
be in no one&rsquo;s way; and each time they were favored with
a look of scrutiny or surprise they fancied that they were
to be ordered to leave the house at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; whispered Dickey, after one
of the porters had looked at them unusually hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mopsey, in an injured tone; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got
all he can out of us, an&rsquo; we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see him agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you go to tryin&rsquo; to be a fool, Mopsey
Dowd,&rdquo; said Ben, indignantly. &ldquo;Polly ain&rsquo;t the kind of
a feller to forget his chums, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m going to stay here till
he comes out, if it ain&rsquo;t till mornin&rsquo;. S&rsquo;posen you had a
father that had got lost, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d jest found him, wouldn&rsquo;t
it be quite a while afore you&rsquo;d think of such a lot of duffers
as we be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mopsey was silent, but not convinced; he shook his head
in a knowing way, as if to say that his companions would
soon see that he had spoken the truth, and then he tried
to push himself farther into the wall in order to occupy
less space in the hall. For fully ten minutes the boys stood
there, first on one foot and then on the other, like motherless
chickens in a rain-storm, and then the turning of the
handle of the door caused them to straighten up into what
they intended should be careless attitudes, which should say
that they had intended to go right away, but had been delayed
by the discussion of some important question. It
was Paul who came out of the room; and if the boys had
had any doubts as to whether they had done right in staying,
they were convinced now, for their companion looked
around as if he were absolutely certain they would be there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father wants to see you; come in,&rdquo; he said, holding
the door open for them to enter.</p>

<p>But they were not disposed to accept the invitation;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
they had waited to see Paul, not his father, and they had
an idea that they should not feel exactly at their ease in
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; insisted Paul; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no one here but father,
and he wants to see all of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mopsey was the first to enter; he had settled it in his
mind that they ought to be invited to see Mr. Weston, and
he considered it his right to go in because of the money he
had contributed towards Paul&rsquo;s ticket to Chicago. The
others followed him, but did not appear as confident as he
did. Whatever extravagant idea Mopsey may have had as
to the way in which they ought to be received by Mr.
Weston, he was not disappointed. Paul&rsquo;s father welcomed
them in the most cordial manner possible, and had they
been his most intimate and esteemed friends they could not
have been received more kindly.</p>

<p>Paul had given his father a brief account of his life since
the time he learned that the steamer had sailed without
him, and he had spoken in the warmest terms of the boys
who had befriended him when he was in such bitter trouble.
After the boys had entered the room, Mr. Weston
explained why it was that he was still in New York City,
when it seemed almost certain that he had sailed for
Europe.</p>

<p>In a very few moments after the steamer had started
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
from the pier Mrs. Weston had asked him to send Paul
to their cabin, she needing his service in some trifling matter;
and when Mr. Weston looked around for his son, of
course he could not be found. A hasty and vain search
was made, and then the boy whom Paul had left behind to
acquaint his father of the important business of buying
tops that had called him away, told the story which he
would probably have told before had he known which one
of the many passengers his newly-made friend&rsquo;s father was.
Leaving his wife and daughter to continue the journey
alone, Mr. Weston had come back with the pilot, and from
that day until then he had searched for his son, never once
thinking that almost any newsboy in the vicinity of City
Hall could have given him full particulars.</p>

<p>Paul had told him of the generosity which his friends
had shown in devoting all the theatrical funds, and nearly
all of the money they had individually, to the purchase of
the ticket to Chicago; and after he had told them how
it was that he had remained in the city, he said, as he took
the ticket Paul was holding in his hand to give back to
his friends,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall keep this ticket, boys, even though Paul will
not need it, for we shall sail for Europe in the next steamer.
I want it as a reminder of generosity and nobility as shown
by four boys, who could not have been censured if they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
had let the lost boy work his own way back to his home.
I shall have it framed, with your names written on it; and
when any one asks the meaning of it, I shall tell them that
it was bought for my son by four noble boys of New
York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben&rsquo;s eyes fairly sparkled with delight as Mr. Weston
bestowed this praise, and Mopsey drew himself up at full
height, as if the idea of doing the charitable deed had
originated with him, instead of his having been opposed
to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; continued Mr. Weston, &ldquo;I shall try to do
something towards repaying you for your kindness to Paul;
but then I have another matter to settle with you. I advertised
that I would give a reward to any one who should
bring me information of my son. You have done that by
bringing the boy himself, and are, therefore, entitled to the
sum I should have paid any one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke he handed some money to Paul, and he in
turn handed it to Ben, who said, as he took it rather unwillingly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any pay for comin&rsquo; here with Polly,
an&rsquo;, besides, it warn&rsquo;t very far, so we won&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;
&rsquo;bout it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All we shall say about it, my boy, is that you will keep
that money in order that I may keep my word. To-morrow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
we will see what can be done to reward you for your
kindness to Paul, and he and I will call at your house
some time in the evening, where I hope you will all wait
for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben concluded from this that Mr. Weston wanted to be
alone with his son, and he said, as he went towards the
door,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep the money, though it don&rsquo;t seem jest right;
it kinder looks as though we was takin&rsquo; what didn&rsquo;t belong
to us, an&rsquo; the only way I know of to get square on it is for
us to give a show all for you alone, an&rsquo; let you come in for
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Weston seemed highly pleased at the novel idea, and
he told them, as he shook their hands in parting, that he
would be obliged to give the matter some considerable attention
before he could accept any such generous offer, but
that they could talk the matter over the following evening.
Paul bade them good-night, with the assurance that he
would see them the next day, and the boys marched out
of the hotel saying not a word, but looking as if they believed
they had grown considerably in importance during
their call.</p>

<p>Once in the street, Mopsey stopped under the nearest
gas-light and asked Ben to see how much money Mr. Weston
had given them. Ben unfolded the bills, which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
held crumpled up in his hand, and the surprise of all four
may be imagined when he unrolled five twenty-dollar notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jinks!&rdquo; squeaked Dickey, with delight, after he had
turned four consecutive hand-springs to quiet himself down
a little, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a hundred dollars; an&rsquo; if we don&rsquo;t swell
&rsquo;round with that it&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;cause we don&rsquo;t know how to put
on style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, quite as fast as they had left Mrs. Green&rsquo;s, they
ran back to relate the startling news, and surprise their
landlady and her daughter with the treasure that had come
because of their generous act.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XIV.</span></h2>

<h3>A DAY&rsquo;S PLEASURING.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>s may be supposed, Paul&rsquo;s good-fortune in finding
his father was the topic of conversation during the
forenoon following that happy event, and there
was even more excitement regarding it in the
news-selling world than there had been when the fact was
first circulated that Ben and Johnny had embarked in a theatrical
enterprise.</p>

<p>Of course the good-fortune that had come to the firm
through Paul was known as soon as the other, and whenever
one of the partners passed a group of merchants in his same
line of business, he was sure to be pointed out as one of the
boys who were the happy possessors of a clear hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>As it was quite likely that Paul and his father would
come down town during the day, no one of the merchants
knowing of the facts went very far from the City Hall, lest
they should miss the chance of seeing him. There was a
great deal of pride manifested because they had had a rich
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
man&rsquo;s son among their number, even though it had only
been for a few days; and those who had tried to drive him
away during the first of his attempts to sell papers now
tried to show how often they had befriended him.</p>

<p>Some even allowed such flights to their imaginations that
they came to believe Paul&rsquo;s father would give them money
enough to make them all rich, and they came to think of
the five cents which they had spent for a theatre ticket as
just so much money given directly to Paul. But the boys
who had actually received money from Mr. Weston were
so much excited by the wealth which had so suddenly become
theirs that they could do no business at all that day.
From the time they had reached home with the hundred
dollars in their pockets they had been in earnest discussion
as to what they should do with their money.</p>

<p>Mopsey had used every argument he could think of to
show that it was not only wise but proper for them to invest
it all in their theatre; and so earnest was he in his attempts
to have it so expended that he took upon himself
the excessive labor of figuring the cash result of ten performances
at the same amount of receipts as those of the
previous Saturday, showing that they would receive in
return the amount of their investment and considerably
more. But he was unable to give any reason as to why
they should not have as liberal patronage if they continued
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
their efforts in the same place without any further outlay
of money.</p>

<p>Ben was willing that a small portion of the amount
should be spent for the purchase of a curtain, and for more
secure foot-lights; but he insisted that the greater portion
of it should be invested where it would be safe.</p>

<p>Dickey was of the same opinion as Ben; and he further
proposed, since Mopsey was so anxious to carry out his
ideas, that rather than spend it all on their theatre they
should divide the money, so that each could do with his
share as he thought best.</p>

<p>Johnny advised buying or starting a news-stand in some
good location, and this Mrs. Green seemed to think was the
most sensible plan of all. Of course the boys knew that
she and Nelly each had a share in the money, and her advice
had great weight with them. But they had come to no
decision when they went to bed that night, and the morning
found them quite as divided in opinion as to what should
be done with their great wealth.</p>

<p>None of the boys, not even Mopsey, had been able to go
to work that day, and the greater portion of the forenoon
was spent in City Hall Square, trying to come to some
understanding about their money. As a matter of course,
they remembered what Mr. Weston had said about rewarding
them still further because of what they had done for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
Paul; but since it was Ben and Johnny who had really
cared for the boy when he did not know where to go or
what to do, they would be the only ones who would probably
be benefited, although Mopsey felt that there was a
great deal yet due him for the theatrical education which
he had bestowed.</p>

<p>While they were still engaged in argument, and with no
more prospect of coming to any agreement in the matter,
Mr. Weston and Paul stood before them, having approached
unobserved, because of the exciting discussion which had
occupied their attention to the exclusion of everything else.
Mr. Weston had heard enough of the conversation to know
that the question of what should be done with the money
he had given them was under discussion, and after seating
himself on one of the benches, with the boys all around
him, he succeeded in gaining their confidence so far that
they talked unreservedly before him.</p>

<p>When each one had advanced his views on the matter,
Mr. Weston agreed with Dickey that it was better for them
to divide it equally, and Paul figured out to them what each
one of the six would have as his portion.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Weston startled them by an invitation which
almost took their breath away. He said that he could not
keep his appointment with them that evening, because of
business matters which would require his attention, but,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
instead, he would invite them, as well as Mrs. Green and
Nelly, to go to Coney Island with himself and Paul for a
holiday.</p>

<p>Of course there was but one answer to such a proposal,
and they accepted it with the greatest pleasure, agreeing to
meet him at the pier on the following morning.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Weston and Paul went to the steamship office
to engage passage to Europe for the coming Saturday, and
the partners went to startle Mrs. Green and her daughter
with the wonderful news. To their great surprise Mrs.
Green, even though she did own one-sixth of the hundred
dollars, decided that she could not afford to close up her
basket-store for the day, even when she had been invited to
make one of the pleasure-party; but she was willing and
anxious for Nelly to go, which was, perhaps, just as well.</p>

<p>Nine o&rsquo;clock was the time when Mr. Weston had said
that he and Paul would meet the party at the pier; but
they, fearing lest they might be late, had arrived there a
little before eight on the following morning, as full of pleasure
as any five children that could have been found in New
York City.</p>

<p>Ben and Johnny presented very nearly the same gorgeous
appearance they had on the night when they first
called on Mrs. Green, while Dickey and Mopsey were attired
in costumes that were models of their own idea of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
fashion. Nelly, who looked very sweet and modest in her
clean gingham dress, had tried in vain to persuade her
friends to go in their usual working-clothes, rather than put
on such a striking array as they did; but each one of the
boys indignantly repelled the idea of showing so little regard
for the gentleman who was to give them so much
pleasure, by not making themselves look as beautiful as possible,
and she could not persuade them to do differently.</p>

<p>It was hardly more than half-past eight when they began
to express their doubts as to whether Mr. Weston would
arrive in time to take the steamer he had designated, and
they were fearing lest they should be disappointed after all,
when Paul and his father arrived.</p>

<p>Mopsey was in favor of giving Mr. Weston three cheers
as a mark of their appreciation and admiration, when that
gentleman appeared at the head of the pier, and, finding
that his companions objected to it, would have done all
the cheering himself if Ben had not forcibly prevented
him by holding his hand firmly over his mouth.</p>

<p>Paul greeted his friends as warmly as if he had been separated
from them for weeks instead of hours, and then the
party went on board the steamer, feeling that they were
justly the observed of all observers.</p>

<p>Mopsey explained everything they saw with a reckless
disregard of accuracy; and if his companions had not known
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
to the contrary, they would have thought that all his life
had been spent on the steamers running from New York to
Coney Island.</p>

<p>It was not until Mr. Weston asked him some question
about the theatre that he laid aside the duties of guide and
historian, to launch out in glowing details of their temple
of histrionic art, which must one day be the resort of the
general public. The others quietly enjoyed the sail, drinking
in deep draughts of pleasure from everything around them
excepting Mopsey&rsquo;s loud boasting.</p>

<p>Johnny seemed plunged in an ecstasy of delight, from
which he emerged but once; and then it was to express
the wish that he might always be a passenger on one of
these steamers, with no other object than to enjoy the continual
sail.</p>

<p>Nelly and Dickey sat side by side, speaking only at rare
intervals, while Paul and Ben discussed the latter&rsquo;s prospects
in life, or spoke of the wonderful journey which the
former was to make in order to rejoin his mother and sister.
As for Mr. Weston, he appeared to find as much enjoyment
in the delight and wonder of his guests as they did in the
sail, and there was every prospect that the holiday would be
a remarkably pleasant one to all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/lbtdn15.jpg" width="600" height="532" alt="" />
<span class="caption">AT CONEY ISLAND.</span>
</div>

<p>When they landed, and were in the very midst of the
pleasure-seeking crowd, which appeared to have no other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
aim than enjoyment, their delight and bewilderment were
so great that even Mopsey was silenced, and could hardly
have been induced to talk even if he had been directly approached
on the subject of the theatre, or the new play he
was supposed to be preparing.</p>

<p>After leading the way to one of the hotels, Mr. Weston,
thinking that perhaps his presence was some check upon
the full enjoyment of his guests, told them that they had all
better go off by themselves to see what was new or wonderful,
while he remained there until they should return, cautioning
them, however, to come back by dinner-time.</p>

<p>It would be almost impossible to describe all they did or
what they said during that forenoon, when they were indulging
in such a day of pleasure as they never had had
before. As Ben afterwards expressed it, they &ldquo;saw about
everything there was to be seen, an&rsquo; they scooped in about
as much fun as ever anybody did who went to Coney
Island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Owing to Paul&rsquo;s watchfulness, they were back at the hotel
at the time Mr. Weston had said they would have dinner,
and Dickey asked, wonderingly, as they entered, and Paul
looked around for his father,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we goin&rsquo; to eat here, jest as if we was reg&rsquo;lar
folks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we are,&rdquo; said Paul, decidedly; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
going to sit down to the table with father, and have just as
good a dinner as we can get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dickey had nothing more to say; he was overwhelmed
with the idea of acting like &ldquo;reg&rsquo;lar folks,&rdquo; and after that
nothing could have astonished him.</p>

<p>Mr. Weston had engaged a private dining-room, in order
that his guests might feel more at their ease if they were
alone than if they went into the public dining-room. The
boys and Nelly seated themselves at the table with as much
solemnity as if they were participating in some very important
ceremony, opening their eyes wide with astonishment
as the waiter brought on the different courses, but never
neglecting to do full justice to everything that was set before
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Weston did all he could to make the dinner seem less
formal; but he did not succeed until after the roast chickens
were put on the table and the servant left the room. Then,
when they were alone, and with three whole chickens before
them, their tongues seemed suddenly to have been loosened,
and they talked as fast as the most fun-loving host could
have asked for, until each one&rsquo;s plate was piled high with
chicken and vegetables, when they relapsed again into silent
activity.</p>

<p>That visit, and more especially that dinner, was a new experience
in their lives, and one which they could never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
forget. They ate until it seemed impossible they could eat
any more, and even then Dickey succeeded in disposing of
an extra piece of pie, together with some nuts and raisins.
After the meal was ended, and before they started out
again to take one more look at all that was strange around
them, Mr. Weston said, as he handed Dickey and Mopsey
each five dollars, and Nelly ten,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to return to some of you the money you paid
for Paul&rsquo;s railroad ticket. Nelly has her mother&rsquo;s share as
well as her own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t pay so much as this,&rdquo; said Dickey, in evident
perplexity. &ldquo;It only cost fourteen dollars in all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That comes near enough to the amount,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Weston, &ldquo;and you will oblige me by thinking that you have
simply had returned to you the money you paid out. As
for Ben and Johnny, who took charge of Paul when he was
sadly in need of some one&rsquo;s care, I have got what I hope
will be a pleasant surprise in store for them; and if they
will come to the hotel at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Paul
and I will show them what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was very little opportunity for any one to make
a reply, for as Mr. Weston spoke he arose from the table,
and then added,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now go and see all that you can until five o&rsquo;clock, and
then we will start for home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
It was a tired party who landed in New York quite early
that evening, some going to Mrs. Green&rsquo;s and two to the
hotel; but they were quite as happy as they were weary, and
had had such a day of enjoyment as they had never even
dreamed of before, which could be set down to the credit of
the kind act of befriending a homeless boy.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XV.</span></h2>

<h3>THE GREAT SURPRISE.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>f Mrs. Green had been able to have understood
what five children were saying to her at one time,
she would have had a very clear idea of that day of
pleasure; but as it was, when each was eager to tell
the story, and all spoke together, she had only a general
idea until she was alone with Nelly.</p>

<p>After the attempt to enlighten her as to where they had
been and what they had seen, the conversation turned upon
the surprise which Mr. Weston said he had for Ben and
Johnny, and many were the speculations as to what it
might be. Mopsey was very certain that he had purchased
one of the largest theatres in the city, and was to present
it to them in due form; and so positive did he become as
to the correctness of his idea, that he would persist in talking
about what they would do after the two boys were installed
there, to the exclusion of everything else. He even
awakened them after they had gone to sleep that night, in
order to make them promise that they would let him direct
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
the entertainments, in case he was right regarding the gift
of a theatre. Of course the two most interested were in a
high state of excitement as to the gift, although they did
not try to guess what it might be. It was a difficult matter
for them to go to sleep after they went to bed, so anxious
were they to know what good-fortune was to be theirs; and
after Mopsey had awakened them, they remained in anything
but a sleepy condition for several hours.</p>

<p>But the morning came at last, as all mornings do come,
and they were the first ones up and dressed, although they
spent a great deal of time on their toilet. Mopsey proposed
that the others escort the two fortunate ones to the
hotel, in order that they might learn what this great surprise
was as soon as possible; but Dickey insisted that Ben
and Johnny go alone, since Mr. Weston had not said anything
about their bringing any friends with them.</p>

<p>It did seem to these two boys, after their companions had
gone to work, that the hands of the clock would never
point to nine. They had walked slowly from their boarding-house
to the hotel, hoping to pass away the time by
looking in the shop-windows; and yet, walking as slowly
as they did, they were on the sidewalk opposite the house
as early as eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>Since they could not content themselves anywhere else,
they remained there until it should be time for them to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
call, still speculating as to what their good-fortune was to
be, and wishing the minutes would pass more quickly. The
clock was just striking the hour of nine when they entered
the office of the hotel, and found Mr. Weston and Paul evidently
awaiting their arrival.</p>

<p>Whatever the surprise was that Mr. Weston had in store
for them, it was not in the hotel that they were to receive
it; for as soon as they entered Paul and his father started
towards them, leading the way out into the street at once.
It was quite evident that Paul did not intend to allow himself
to run any risk of betraying the secret, for he walked
on ahead with his father, glancing over his shoulder every
few moments at the puzzled-looking boys behind.</p>

<p>Down Twenty-third Street to Sixth Avenue Mr. Weston
led the way, and after they had gone down the avenue some
distance he entered a neat-looking little periodical and stationary
store, nodding familiarly to the proprietor, as if he
had been a regular visitor there. Now more then ever
were the two boys perplexed, and they had just come to
the conclusion that Paul&rsquo;s father was going to buy them
something as a present when the proprietor said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the money which has been taken this morning is in
the drawer, and unless there is something more you want
to say to me I will go, as I made an engagement down
town for ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is anything more to be said,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Weston; &ldquo;of course you will come in whenever you
are passing this way to see how matters are going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; and the man started towards the door; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see that everything goes on smoothly, although I have no
doubt but that the new proprietors will get along all right.
The goods are all marked at the selling price, and there
can hardly be any mistake made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the man went out, and they were left alone in the
store, which, to say the least, seemed a very strange proceeding
to Ben and Johnny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, what do you think of the store?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Weston; and as they hardly knew what reply to make, he
added, &ldquo;I hope you will like it, for I think you can make
considerable money here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We make money here?&rdquo; asked Ben, in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, for it all belongs to you. I bought the stock in
your name, with myself as trustee, since minors can&rsquo;t hold
property, and the rent is paid for one year. You must be
careful to keep the stock well up with good, seasonable
articles, and if you work hard there is no reason why you
should not have a good-sized bank account by the end of
the year.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>
<img src="images/lbtdn16.jpg" width="600" height="528" alt="" />
<span class="caption">BEN AND JOHNNY ALONE IN THE NEW STORE.</span>
</div>

<p>The boys looked at each other and then at Mr. Weston,
but appeared unable to understand what he meant. It did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
not seem possible that all those goods were theirs, and they
were quite sure that they had misunderstood what he said,
or that he was not speaking to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of these goods are yours&mdash;Paul&rsquo;s present to you for
your kindness to him. I guess you will understand it after
a while, and we will come back presently, after you feel perfectly
sure about the proprietorship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Paul and his father went out, leaving the two owners
to stand looking at each other as if they were uncertain
as to their own identity. It was some moments before they
spoke after they were alone, and then Johnny went near
the door and stood on his head, in a grave, business-like
manner, until his face was as red as a boiled beet. After
this feat had been accomplished he appeared to feel considerably
relieved, and he said, as he went close up to Ben,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you s&rsquo;pose he meant jest what he said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have meant it,&rdquo; replied Ben; but the look on
his face told that even then he was uncertain about it.</p>

<p>Then the boys began examining their stock, finding beautiful
things, such as they had admired from outside shop-windows,
but never believed they should really own.</p>

<p>When Paul came in alone, half an hour later&mdash;for he was
too eager to know what his friends thought of their store to
be able to wait any longer&mdash;he found the newly-made proprietors
in a state of delight bordering almost on frenzy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
They shook him by the hands, hugged him, and once Johnny
looked as if he would have kissed him had it not been
that he was a little ashamed to do so, while they kept asking
him over and over again if he was quite sure that his father
had really given them that entire stock of goods all for
their very own.</p>

<p>When Paul told them that his father had spoken of doing
some such thing as this the first night that he had found
him, after hearing the story of what the two had done for
his son, and that the money had been paid over that very
morning in his presence, they became fully assured of their
good-fortune.</p>

<p>Johnny, by Ben&rsquo;s direction, started down town to inform
their friends of their magnificent gift, and to invite them
all up to look the property over; which invitation, it is almost
unnecessary to say, was accepted at once.</p>

<p>During the greater portion of that day the store was filled
with such a crowd of newsboys and boot-blacks as was
never seen in that vicinity before, and the other merchants
looked out in alarm, as if they feared that a riot was in
progress.</p>

<p>Dickey was almost as delighted as the proprietors themselves
at this magnificent gift; but Mopsey did not hesitate
to say that, from what he had seen of Mr. Weston, he
fully expected that he would have been sensible enough to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
have purchased a theatre; and the author also intimated that
some folks did not recognize genius when they saw it, or he
would have been both proprietor and manager of a theatre,
in the place of Ben and Johnny being installed behind the
counter of a periodical depot.</p>

<p>Paul had his father&rsquo;s permission to remain at the store all
day, for he was as much delighted with it as were the new
owners, and he received quite as much attention from the
visitors as the goods did, all seeming to think him a curiosity,
and all equally certain that they would have cared for him
as willingly as Ben and Johnny did had he met them first.</p>

<p>It was quite late in the afternoon when Mr. Weston returned
to see how the new merchants were getting along,
and both of them tried to express their thanks for what he
had done for them; but it was a difficult matter to find
words to convey all they felt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to thank me, my lads, but live so that you
will merit the confidence I now have in you. The money
which I have paid out to buy these goods is but a small part
of what I would have been willing to give to have known
that I should find my son alive and well. From what he
has told me of you, I believe that you deserve this start in
life; and if you continue as honest and kindly-hearted as
I think you are, you will repay me for this in almost as
great a proportion as you already have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
After Mr. Weston had explained to them several details
of business which it was necessary they should know, he
went back to the hotel, taking Paul with him, but promising
that he should come back and help them keep store all
the next day, since it would be the last he would be in New
York for some time.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys thought of going home for anything
to eat until it should be time for them to close the store,
and in the evening Mrs. Green and Nelly called upon them
to say that they had purposely delayed dinner until they
could be there, when it would be made a sort of thanksgiving
meal. As a matter of course, they were as much
delighted with the store as any of the other visitors had
been, and Mrs. Green took advantage of the occasion to
point out to Mopsey what the difference might have been
if he had refused to help a companion in distress, as he
apparently had been on the point of doing when he was
appealed to for his share of the money with which to buy
the ticket.</p>

<p>Since there was quite a trade in daily papers at the new
store, and it would be inconvenient for the two boys to
buy and deliver their papers and attend to the store at the
same time, they made a trade with Dickey, whereby he
should become a partner to the extent of one-third of
the profits&mdash;thereby making him quite as happy as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
were, which was more happy than can be described by
words.</p>

<p>Very proud were the three partners as they locked the
store that night, and, with the keys in their pockets, walked
home with Mrs. Green and Nelly, surrounded by quite a
numerous escort of their particular and intimate friends.
And as they passed the different stores into which they
had hardly dared to enter even when they were pursuing
their legitimate business, they seemed suddenly to have degenerated
into very shabby affairs since they had one of
their own which was so beautiful.</p>

<p>Of the meal which followed Mrs. Green had made quite
a feast, in order to celebrate the good-fortune which had
come to two of her boarders. A cold boiled ham with
smoking hot potatoes, followed by pies and fruit, made
up a dinner that would have been thought fit for a king,
had it not been for the remembrance of the &ldquo;swell affair&rdquo;
at Coney Island. All were in the best of spirits save Mopsey;
and when Dickey asked the cause of his apparent trouble,
it was learned that the present of the store was a severe
blow to him, since it deprived him of nearly all his theatrical
company, as well as partners in the enterprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Mopsey,&rdquo; said Ben, after he had
whispered with Johnny and Dickey, and they had nodded
their heads as if agreeing with what he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
you our share of the theatre&mdash;&rsquo;cause, of course, we can&rsquo;t
spend any time actin&rsquo;, now that we&rsquo;ve got the store, an&rsquo;
you an&rsquo; Nelly can own it alone. You can get some other
actors, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll buy tickets every time you have a show,
whether we can come or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This present was all Mopsey needed to make him as happy
as if he had been given an interest in the store. He
began to think of such of his friends as he was quite positive
would make bright and shining lights in the dramatic
world, and was so generous as to offer to tell them all about
the play as soon as he should have it mapped out in his
mind.</p>

<p>When the partners went to bed that night, impressed
with a sense of their growing importance, Johnny remarked
to Ben, just as his eyes were closing in sleep,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re reg&rsquo;lar folks at last, ain&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Ben quite agreed with him.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter XVI.</span></h2>

<h3>IN CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>s Paul had agreed, he spent the next day with
Ben and Johnny in their store; and surely no
shopman ever felt more pride in selling goods
than they did. Paul acted as clerk; and a very
inquisitive one he was, too, for he insisted on looking everywhere,
so that he should know just what kind of goods his
friends had for sale.</p>

<p>Trade was very good; and when the money was counted
for about the fifteenth time, and it was found that they
had sold twenty dollars&rsquo; worth of goods, there was not one
of the four who did not believe that in less than a year
Ben and Johnny would be numbered among the merchant
princes of the country.</p>

<p>When it was time for Paul to go back to the hotel, the
question of escorting him to the steamer arose, for he was
to make one more effort to start with his father for Europe,
and it was quite certain that there would be no mistake
this time. The steamer was to sail at ten o&rsquo;clock; and of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
course all the boys could not go, since some one must be
left to attend to the store, though who that unfortunate one
would be promised to be a vexing question, till Ben said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the oldest, an&rsquo; so I s&rsquo;pose it must be me. I&rsquo;ll have
to say good-bye now, Polly, for I can&rsquo;t see you in the
mornin&rsquo;. When you come back, be sure an&rsquo; come up here,
won&rsquo;t you? And if you&rsquo;ll write to us, Johnny an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll answer
you back, for we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to study awful hard, now
that we&rsquo;ve got a store of our own, an&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t be long before
we can write an&rsquo; figger an&rsquo; do all them things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul promised that he would send letters regularly to
his friends; and when he left the store with Dickey to
be sure that he did not miss the way, Ben felt more sad
at parting with him than he would have thought it possible
for a boy to feel who was half owner of such a beautiful
store.</p>

<p>The business of selling newspapers seemed to have been
nearly forsaken the next morning, for fully forty newsboys
and at least a dozen boot-blacks were at the pier to say
good-bye to Polly Weston, the boy who had once seemed
so forlorn, and who had played Hamlet so successfully.
Paul was highly pleased at such attention on the part of
his acquaintances, and he presented nearly all of them to
his father, who was not a little surprised at the number of
friends his son had made in so short a time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
After Paul had said good-bye to each one individually,
and was just about going on board the steamer, Mopsey
stopped him, taking him aside with a great show of secrecy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I own all the theatre now, Polly,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
when you come back I&rsquo;ll let you be one of the actors, if
you want to, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll fix up a play where you&rsquo;ll have all the
best chances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul thanked Mopsey for his kindness; but before he
could say whether he accepted the generous offer or not,
his father called him, and he was obliged to go on board,
leaving the sole proprietor (and author) of the theatre at a
loss to know whether he should write a play especially for
Paul or not.</p>

<p>Then the huge steamer slowly started from the dock, and
Paul stood near the stern, where he could see his army of
small acquaintances, the greater portion of whom had been
so kind to him when he most needed friends. The ragged
crowd were all swinging their hats, and Paul had just begun
to wave his handkerchief when Mopsey saw the chance
to bestow a very delicate compliment. Jumping on a pile
of merchandise, where he could better see and be seen, he
waved his hat furiously and shouted, in his shrillest dramatic
key,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Polly, an&rsquo; three more for Polly&rsquo;s father!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
Then that crowd of boys swarmed up over everything
that would raise them more prominently into view, pushing
aside any one in their way, and both looking and acting
like a hive of bees getting ready to swarm, until they
stood high above all the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; shouted Mopsey; and then the cheers were
given with a will that startled the officers of the ship into
looking around to see what distinguished passengers they
had on board.</p>

<p>Then Paul waved his hat, the boys cheered again, and
the ship was so far out into the stream that no more courtesies
could be exchanged.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It is now two years since Paul Weston started for Europe,
and he is expected home in a few weeks, as Ben or
Johnny will tell you in case you should make inquiries.
In that time very many gradual but not startling changes
have been made in those boys whom we left in New York;
therefore it may be assumed that Paul has also changed
considerably, and in all probability for the better.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/lbtdn17.jpg" width="600" height="555" alt="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;THREE CHEERS FOR POLLY!&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Ben, Johnny, and Dickey are still in business in the same
place that Mr. Weston purchased for them, but one would
hardly recognize the dirty, ragged boys whom Paul first met,
in the neat, gentlemanly little tradesmen who are so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
courteous to their patrons, and so prompt in all their business
transactions. That they did study, as Ben told Paul they
would, is shown by their manner of speaking, their accounts,
which are kept in the most precise order, and their
general information when one enters into conversation with
them.</p>

<p>And their business has improved quite as much as they
have. By strict attention to it, and by integrity in all their
dealings, they have gained new customers so fast that they
are now obliged to use every available inch of space; and
they intend to hire the next store, making the two into one
large shop, as soon as Mr. Weston comes home to advise
with them regarding it.</p>

<p>They still board with Mrs. Green; she has gone out of
the fruit business now entirely, has moved into the dwelling
directly over their store, and does nothing but attend to
her boarders. Nelly, when she is not at school, acts as clerk
for the boys, and is very useful to the firm during the rush
of morning and evening trade.</p>

<p>Mopsey has gone out of the theatrical business altogether.
He gave two more performances, but they were not as great
successes as he had fancied they would be, and required
more of his time than he could afford to give. He has given
up both play writing and acting, very much to the benefit
of his legitimate business. He still sells pea-nuts at Fulton
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
Ferry, and has capital enough to start on a larger scale,
which he says he shall do in another year.</p>

<p>About a year ago Dickey met Tim Dooley, the boy who
made him bankrupt; but he did not try to make him return
any of the money he had stolen. Tim was doing a
small business in the way of blackening boots, having reaped
no benefit from his ill-gotten gains, and Dickey, so far from
showing any feeling of resentment, talked kindly to the
boy, and offered to be his friend again if he would try to
be honest.</p>

<p>Paul kept his promise, and wrote to his former partners
very regularly. He had not neglected his studies while he
was away, and in the last letter which the firm received
from him he stated that in a few weeks he would return
for the purpose of going to school in this country. He also
wrote that his father had promised to let him remain a fortnight
in New York, during which time he would be with
his old friends, and again live over the time when he was a
newsboy for ten days.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The story of Ben and Johnny is a true one; their start in
life is not without many parallels. To be sure, it is but seldom
that such opportunities for advancement come; but
each boy has it within himself to win his way in the world
quite as well as either Ben, Johnny, or Dickey. May all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
my young readers who have followed the fortunes of these
three try to win the good opinion of those around them
by earnest, honest purpose and integrity, like these boys,
who knew no home until they made one for themselves.</p>
